### LinkedIn Post 1 - Founder Story
```
I built ArtImageHub because professional photo restoration is broken.

The problem:
- Family photos deteriorate every year
- Professional restoration costs $50-200/photo
- DIY requires hours in Photoshop
- Most people just let memories fade away

The solution:
AI-powered restoration in 30 seconds.

How it works:
1. Upload your old photo
2. AI analyzes damage (scratches, fading, blur)
3. Multiple neural networks process simultaneously
4. Download restored photo

Pricing:
- 3 photos FREE (no signup, no credit card)
- $29.9 one-time for unlimited forever

We've processed 10,000+ family photos in 3 months.

If you have old family photos gathering dust, give it a try:

The AI stack behind modern photo restoration:

At ArtImageHub, we combine multiple neural networks:

1. GFPGAN - Face enhancement
   - Specifically trained on human faces
   - Preserves original features
   - Doesn't create "AI face" artifacts

2. Real-ESRGAN - Super resolution
   - 4x upscaling without blur
   - Edge preservation
   - Detail hallucination for lost information

3. Custom colorization model
   - Trained on historical photos
   - Period-accurate color palettes
   - Natural skin tones

4. Damage detection CNN
   - Identifies scratches, tears, stains
   - Contextual inpainting
   - Preserves important details

The result: 30-second restoration that used to take professionals hours.
