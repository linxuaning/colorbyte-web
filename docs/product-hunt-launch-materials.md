## 3. First Comment Template

### Maker's First Comment (Post Immediately After Launch)

```
Hey Product Hunt!

I built ArtImageHub because I found boxes of my grandparents' photos in the attic—faded, scratched, some torn. Professional restoration quotes were $50-100 per photo. For hundreds of photos, that wasn't realistic.

So I built this tool. It uses AI to:
- Remove scratches and damage automatically
- Enhance blurry faces (especially important for old photos)
- Colorize black & white photos
- Upscale to 4K resolution

The whole process takes about 30 seconds per photo.

**What makes us different:**
- No signup required to try (just upload)
- Free tier: 3 photos, no watermarks
- One-time $29.9 for lifetime unlimited (no subscription trap)

**Technical details for the curious:**
We use multiple AI models working together—face enhancement, damage detection, colorization, and super-resolution. The models are optimized for vintage photos specifically.

I'd love your feedback! Especially interested in:
- What other restoration features would help?
- Any edge cases where it doesn't work well?

Try it at artimagehub.com - the first 3 are completely free.

Thanks for checking it out! Happy to answer any questions.
```

### Key Elements Checklist:
- [x] Personal story (grandparents' photos)
- [x] Problem statement (expensive professional restoration)
- [x] Clear features list
- [x] Differentiators (no signup, one-time pricing)
- [x] Technical credibility
- [x] Call for feedback (engagement driver)
- [x] Clear CTA with pricing

## 8. Response Templates for Common Questions

### "How is this different from [competitor]?"
```
Great question! Unlike [competitor], ArtImageHub:
1. No signup required to try (just upload)
2. One-time $29.9 lifetime pricing (no monthly subscription)
3. Specifically optimized for vintage family photos, not just generic enhancement

The AI models are trained on historical photo damage patterns, so they handle fading, scratches, and old printing artifacts better than general-purpose tools.
```

### "Does it work on [specific photo type]?"
```
It works best on:
- Family portraits (1900s-1990s)
- Black & white photos
- Faded color photos
- Photos with scratches, tears, stains

It may have limitations with:
- Extremely damaged photos (>50% missing)
- Non-photographic images
- Very low resolution inputs

Try your specific photo for free—you'll see results in 30 seconds!
```

### "What's the catch with free tier?"
```
No catch! Free tier gives you:
- 3 full restorations
- Full quality output (not watermarked)
- No signup required

We want you to see the quality before deciding. If you have more than 3 photos, $29.9 gives lifetime unlimited access—still cheaper than one professional restoration.
```

### "Is my data safe?"
```
Yes, we take privacy seriously:
- Photos are processed and deleted within 24 hours
- We don't use your photos for AI training
- No account = no personal data stored
- SSL encryption for all uploads

For paid users, we store nothing beyond the transaction record needed for support.
```

## 9. Social Proof to Include (If Available)

### Metrics to Highlight
- Number of photos restored (if tracked)
- User testimonials (if collected)
- Media mentions (if any)
- Technical achievements (AI model accuracy, speed)

### Example Social Proof Statements
```
"Restored 1,000+ family photos in beta"

"Trained on 100,000+ vintage photo samples"
```

## 10. Contingency Plans
