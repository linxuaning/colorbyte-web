## Engagement Playbook

### First 60 Minutes After Posting (CRITICAL)

**Minutes 0-15:**
1. Self-reply with bonus tip or clarification
2. Like first 5 comments immediately
3. Reply to first 3 comments substantively

**Minutes 15-30:**
4. Quote-tweet with different hook angle
5. Reply to all new comments
6. Look for quote-tweets and engage

**Minutes 30-60:**
7. Pin thread to profile
8. Reply to every comment (builds algorithm favor)
9. Find relevant conversations to join (don't spam link)

### Reply Templates

**For "How did you restore them?"**
```
I used ArtImageHub (artimagehub.com) - free to try, no signup. The AI does most of the work in about 30 seconds. Happy to answer specific questions!
```

**For "This is amazing!"**
```
Thanks! The technology has gotten incredible. If you have old photos to restore, definitely give it a try - you might be surprised what's hidden in those faded images.
```

**For skeptical comments:**
```
I get the skepticism! The results vary by damage type. Best approach: try a free tool on one photo and see for yourself. Nothing to lose, potentially a lot to gain.
```

**For "Where can I get this done?"**
```
There are several options! I personally use ArtImageHub (free trial, no signup). Results depend on the photo condition - some come out stunning, some need more work.
```

## Quote-Tweet Strategy

### Day After Each Thread

Post a quote-tweet with alternate angle:

**Thread #10 QT:**
```
The response to this has been overwhelming.

So many people sharing stories about photos they wish they'd restored in time.

If this thread made you think of a photo - that's your sign.

Don't be the person who waits too long.
```

**Thread #2 QT:**
```
Real talk: I've seen people insure jewelry worth less than their family photos.

You can replace jewelry. You can't replace a photo of someone who's gone.

Priorities.
```

**Thread #9 QT:**
```
The most-asked question: "Where do I start?"

1. Gather the photos (attic, relatives, albums)
2. Scan them (phone works if no scanner)
3. Restore damaged ones (AI makes this easy)
4. Create something meaningful

That's it. Start this weekend.
```

## Cross-Platform Amplification

### LinkedIn (Same Day, 2 Hours Later)

Reformat thread as single long post:
- Remove thread numbering
- Add professional context
- Include "Originally posted on X/Twitter" link
- Use LinkedIn-appropriate hashtags

### Instagram Stories (Next Day)

- Screenshot best thread tweets
- Add "Link in bio" sticker
- Create carousel from before/after images

## Performance Tracking

### Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Target (per thread) | Great Performance |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Impressions | 5,000+ | 20,000+ |

| Link clicks | 50+ | 200+ |
| Retweets | 20+ | 100+ |
| Quote tweets | 5+ | 25+ |
| New followers | 10+ | 50+ |

### Adjustment Triggers

**If thread underperforms (< 2K impressions in 24h):**
1. Quote-tweet with stronger hook
2. Reply to your own thread with controversial take
3. Tag relevant accounts (carefully, not spammy)

**If thread goes viral (> 50K impressions):**
1. Don't post next scheduled thread immediately
