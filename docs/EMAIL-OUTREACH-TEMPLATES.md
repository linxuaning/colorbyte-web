Hi [First Name],

I've been reading [Site Name] for a while - particularly enjoyed your piece on [specific article title]. The tip about [specific detail from article] was something I hadn't considered before.

I'd love to contribute a guest post to [Site Name]. Here are a few topic ideas that might resonate with your readers:

2. "How AI Is Helping Genealogists Identify Unknown Ancestors"
3. "5 Damaged Photo Types That AI Can Actually Restore"

Each would be 1,500-2,000 words with original images and practical takeaways.

Would any of these work for your editorial calendar? Happy to adjust based on what your readers would find most valuable.

- Mention in our blog posts where relevant
- Social media shoutout to our audience
- Genuine testimonial for your site

What I'm hoping for:
- Similar mention/feature on your site
- Recommendation to your users who need photo restoration
- Testimonial exchange

This could be as simple or comprehensive as you'd like. Even a small mutual mention helps both of our audiences find useful tools.
