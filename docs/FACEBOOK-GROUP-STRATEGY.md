## Post Templates (7 Templates)

### Template #1: Before/After Showcase (Most Effective)

**Type:** Photo post with transformation

```
I finally restored my grandmother's wedding photo from 1952 😭

For 70 years it sat in a drawer, fading away. I could barely see her face anymore.

Decided to try AI photo restoration and I'm still emotional looking at the result.

[BEFORE/AFTER IMAGE]

The scratches are gone. The fading is corrected. And I can finally see her smile.

If anyone else has been putting off restoring old family photos - don't wait. The technology has gotten incredibly good and many tools are free to try.

Has anyone else restored family photos recently? I'd love to see your before/afters! ❤️
```

**Best For:** All genealogy/photo groups
**Expected Engagement:** 50-200 reactions, 20-50 comments

---

### Template #2: Question/Help Request (Community Engagement)

**Type:** Text post asking for advice

```
Question for the group 🤔

I have about 50 old family photos that need restoration - various levels of damage (fading, scratches, some water damage).

Has anyone tried AI photo restoration tools recently? I've heard they've gotten pretty good but wanted to hear real experiences before I spend hours on this project.

Specifically wondering:
- What tools did you use?
- How did results compare to professional restoration?
- Any tips for getting the best results?

Thanks in advance! 🙏
```

**Best For:** Restoration-focused groups
**Expected Engagement:** 30-100 comments with recommendations

---

### Template #3: Educational/Tip Share (Value-First)

**Type:** Helpful tip post

```
💡 TIP: Why all your 1970s photos have turned orange (and what to do about it)

I learned something fascinating recently about why nearly EVERY color photo from the 1970s looks orange/red now.

The cyan dye layer in Kodak film was chemically unstable. It fades faster than the other colors. Without cyan to balance, photos shift to orange.

The good news? AI restoration tools can mathematically reconstruct what the cyan layer SHOULD look like and restore the original colors.

I tested this on my parents' wedding photos from 1978 - the difference is dramatic!

Anyone else have 70s photos they thought were "ruined"? They might be recoverable!

**Best For:** Genealogy tip groups
**Expected Engagement:** 100-300 reactions, shares

### Template #4: Success Story (Social Proof)

**Type:** Personal story post

```
Success story! Finally identified the mystery people in my great-grandmother's photo 📷

I had this photo for years but the faces were too faded to recognize. My 92-year-old great-aunt couldn't identify anyone.

Last week I tried AI photo restoration. The facial details that came back were amazing.

Showed my great-aunt the restored version and she IMMEDIATELY recognized them:
"That's my mother's sister, Aunt Rose! And her husband Samuel! I haven't seen this photo clearly in 60 years!"

We spent 2 hours going through old photos after that. Stories I never would have heard otherwise.

If you have mystery photos in your collection - try restoring them and showing elderly relatives while you still can. The stories die with them.

What mystery photos do you have in your collection?
```

**Best For:** Genealogy research groups
**Expected Engagement:** 50-150 reactions, story shares in comments

---

### Template #5: Resource Share (Helpful Link)

**Type:** Sharing a resource

```
Free resource for anyone with damaged family photos 📸

I've been restoring my family photo collection and wanted to share something that's been really helpful.

There are several free AI tools that can:
✅ Remove scratches and damage
✅ Fix fading and color shifts
✅ Enhance blurry faces
✅ Colorize black & white photos

The one I've been using (artimagehub.com) lets you try 3 photos free with no signup.

Not affiliated - just sharing because it saved me probably $500+ in professional restoration costs.

Has anyone else found helpful free tools for genealogy work? Would love to hear recommendations! 🔍
```

**Best For:** Resource-sharing groups
**Expected Engagement:** Saves, shares, thank you comments

---

### Template #6: Project Update (Work in Progress)

**Type:** Multi-photo post

```
Family reunion project update! 📷

Remember when I asked for advice on restoring 50+ family photos for our reunion?

Well, here's what I accomplished this week:
- Scanned all photos at 600 DPI ✅
- Restored 35 damaged photos with AI ✅
- Identified 12 "mystery" relatives ✅
- Created timeline display boards ✅

[COLLAGE OF BEFORE/AFTERS]

The oldest photo: 1892 (my great-great-grandparents!)
The most dramatic restoration: 1972 wedding photo (was completely orange)

Next step: Getting the surviving relatives together to label everyone!

Anyone else working on a family photo project? Would love to hear about it!

```

**Best For:** Project-oriented groups
**Expected Engagement:** High interest, follow-up questions

---

### Template #7: Direct Question (Problem-Solution)

**Type:** Direct help request

```
Can anyone help? 🆘

I have my great-grandparents' only surviving wedding photo from 1923, but it's in rough shape:
- Severely faded
- Torn corner
- Water stains

I'm trying to decide between:
A) Professional restoration ($150-200 quoted)
B) AI restoration tools (free/cheap)

For those who've tried both - is AI good enough for something this important? Or should I save up for professional work?

The photo means a lot to our family and I don't want to mess it up.

Any advice appreciated! 🙏
```

## Comment Response Templates

### When someone asks "What tool did you use?"

```
I've been using ArtImageHub (artimagehub.com) - it's free to try with no signup needed. You just upload a photo and get results in about 30 seconds. I've tried a few different tools and this one gave me the best results for face enhancement specifically. But definitely try a couple and see what works best for your photos!
```

### When someone shares their own restoration

```
This is beautiful! What a transformation. I love seeing these before/afters - it's amazing how much detail is hidden in those old faded photos. Thanks for sharing! ❤️
```

### When someone is skeptical

```
I totally understand the skepticism! I was too at first. What convinced me was just trying it on one photo - there's nothing to lose with free trials. The technology has gotten surprisingly good in the past couple years. Not perfect for everything, but for common issues like fading and scratches, the results often surprise people.
```

### When someone asks for recommendations

```
For basic fading and scratches, I've had good luck with AI tools like ArtImageHub. For really severe damage (like half a face missing), you might still want a professional. What kind of damage does your photo have? I can give more specific suggestions based on that.
```
