## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can photos damaged by Vietnam's tropical climate be restored?**

Short answer: Usually yes, significantly. Tropical humidity causes mold, color fading, and physical damage, but our [AI restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) effectively addresses these issues. Results depend on severity, but meaningful improvement is typically achievable.

**Why have my Vietnam War color photos turned pink/magenta?**

Short answer: This is extremely common. The cyan dye in 1960s-70s color prints fades fastest, leaving the magenta dye dominant. This creates the pink/red color cast. Our restoration tool corrects this color shift, restoring natural colors to faded Vietnam-era photos.

**How do I research a Vietnam veteran's service from their photos?**

Short answer: Examine unit patches and insignia for unit identification. Search National Archives Vietnam records. The Virtual Wall and Vietnam Veterans Memorial have extensive resources. Unit associations often maintain histories. Combine photo evidence with service records research.

**Should I restore Vietnam War photos for a veteran who doesn't talk about service?**

Short answer: Approach sensitively. Some veterans find restored photos meaningful; others find them difficult. Consider offering the restoration as an option rather than a surprise. Some families restore photos after veterans pass as a memorial. Respect individual feelings about the war.

**Can combat zone photos from Vietnam be enhanced?**

Short answer: Yes. Combat photos often suffered from difficult conditions, but our [enhancement tool](/enhance-old-photos) can improve clarity, correct exposure issues, and repair damage. The goal is visibility improvement while maintaining the documentary authenticity of these historical images.
