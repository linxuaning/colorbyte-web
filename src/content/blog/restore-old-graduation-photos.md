## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can faded graduation caps and gowns be restored to black?**

Short answer: Yes, AI restoration can effectively restore the proper black color to faded academic regalia. The fabric texture and depth can also be enhanced. Our [enhancement tool](/enhance-old-photos) handles black fabric restoration well while maintaining realistic appearance.

**How do I restore a group graduation photo with many faces?**

Short answer: AI restoration can enhance multiple faces simultaneously. For large group photos, expect some variation in results across different faces. Focus on ensuring the graduate you care about most is well-restored. Our tool processes the entire image but allows you to check specific individuals.

**Can colorized graduation photos be historically accurate?**

Short answer: Largely yes. Academic regalia colors are well-documented—universities maintain color standards over time. Yearbooks and university archives can provide references. Our [colorization tool](/colorize-photos-free) can add appropriate colors based on the institution's documented regalia colors.

**How do I find out what academic honors my ancestor earned from their graduation photo?**

Short answer: Look for honor cords, stoles, or hood colors that indicate achievements. Research the institution's regalia traditions for that era. Compare to yearbooks or commencement programs from the same year. University archives can often help interpret academic insignia.

**Should I restore each graduation photo or create a composite family graduation display?**

Short answer: Restore individual photos first for best quality. Then you can create compilations showing educational progress—kindergarten through doctorate, or generations of family graduates. Our tool works on individual images, which can then be arranged into displays.
