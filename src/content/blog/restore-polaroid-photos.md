## Polaroid-Specific Challenges

### Why Polaroids Fade

- Humidity causes emulsion issues

### Common Polaroid Problems

| Issue | Cause | Restoration Success |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Color fading | Dye deterioration | Excellent |
| Yellow/green cast | Chemical breakdown | Very Good |
| White border yellowing | Paper aging | Good |
| Image separation | Humidity | Varies |
