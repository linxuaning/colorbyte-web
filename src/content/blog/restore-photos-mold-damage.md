Mold and mildew damage occurs when photographs are stored in humid environments like basements, attics, or flood-affected areas. While physical mold requires careful handling, digital restoration can often recover the underlying image.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can photos with visible mold spots be restored?**

Short answer: Yes, if the underlying image remains. Mold spots appear as distinct discolorations that AI can identify and correct. Our [restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) removes the visual evidence of mold damage while recovering the original image beneath.

**Is it safe to handle moldy photos?**

Short answer: Take precautions—wear gloves and a mask, work in ventilated space. Mold spores can cause allergic reactions. For severely affected photos, consider professional conservation services for physical handling, then restore digitally.

**Will the mold smell affect digital restoration?**

Short answer: Digital restoration only affects the visual image—odors remain with the physical photo. After scanning, the digital file has no odor. Store originals separately in sealed containers with odor absorbers if keeping them.
