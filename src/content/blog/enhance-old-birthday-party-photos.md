## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can photos taken by candlelight be improved?**

Short answer: Yes. Our [AI enhancement tool](/enhance-old-photos) can balance candle-lit faces with dark backgrounds, bringing out detail while preserving the warm, celebratory atmosphere of the original moment. The distinctive candlelight effect is maintained while visibility improves.

**How do I restore faded birthday cake colors?**

Short answer: AI color correction can restore cake frosting colors, candle vibrancy, and decoration details. Even severely faded photos often contain enough information to restore recognizable colors. The festive appearance can be dramatically improved.

**Can motion-blurred photos of excited birthday children be fixed?**

Short answer: Moderately. AI can reduce the appearance of motion blur and enhance detail, but severe blur has physical limits. The goal becomes making the photo more viewable and preserving the joyful moment, even if not perfectly sharp.

**Should I restore birthday photos that include people I've lost touch with or relatives who passed?**

Short answer: Yes—these photos document your or your family member's life celebrations. The people present were important at that moment. Restoration preserves that history. You can always crop or focus on specific individuals if desired for certain uses.

**How do I organize a lifetime of birthday photos?**

Short answer: Create a chronological collection for each person showing their birthdays through the years. Note ages, themes, and who attended. This becomes a powerful visual biography showing growth and family changes. Digital organization makes this especially effective.
