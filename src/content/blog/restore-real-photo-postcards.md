Real photo postcards (RPPCs) represent a unique category of photographs—actual photographic prints made on postcard stock rather than mass-printed lithographs. Popular from the 1900s through the 1950s, these cards documented everything from family portraits to local disasters, creating an invaluable historical record. If you have real photo postcards in your collection, understanding their restoration and preservation is essential.

## Understanding Real Photo Postcards

Real photo postcards differ fundamentally from printed postcards—they are actual photographs.

### What Makes Them "Real Photos"

**Photographic Process**:
- Actual silver gelatin photographs
- Printed on sensitized postcard stock
- Each one made individually
- Original photographic print
- Not mass-produced lithographs

**Key Differences from Printed Postcards**:
| Feature | Real Photo Postcard | Printed Postcard |
|---------|--------------------| -----------------|
| Image | Continuous tone photograph | Halftone dot pattern |
| Surface | Glossy or matte photo paper | Printed paper texture |
| Production | Individual prints | Mass printing |
| Uniqueness | May be one-of-a-kind | Thousands identical |
| Value | Often higher | Usually lower |

### Historical Context

**Golden Age (1900-1920)**:
- Kodak introduced postcard-back photo paper
- Amateur photographers could make own cards
- Studios offered postcard portraits
- Mailed extensively (penny postage)
- Document small-town America

**Decline (1920s-1950s)**:
- Printed postcards became cheaper
- Amateur photography shifted formats
- Commercial production dominated
- Still used for portraits, events
- Increasingly rare by 1950s

### Common RPPC Subjects

**Highly Collectible**:
- Street scenes and storefronts
- Disasters (floods, fires, tornadoes)
- Transportation (trains, early cars, ships)
- Occupational images
- Sports teams and events
- Small town documentation

**Family Types**:
- Studio portraits
- Group photos
- Home and farm scenes
- Events (weddings, funerals)
- Vacation and travel images

## Identifying Real Photo Postcards

Correctly identifying RPPCs helps with dating and valuation.

### Visual Identification

**Signs of Real Photo**:
- Continuous photographic tone
- No dot pattern when magnified
- Photographic paper surface
- Sometimes uneven development
- May have handwritten messages

**Signs of Printed Postcard**:
- Halftone dot pattern visible
- Uniform ink coverage
- Printed paper texture
- Consistent across all copies
- Usually captioned

### Dating by Postcard Back

**Stamp Box Styles**:
- 1901-1907: Undivided back (message on front only)
- 1907-1915: Divided back, various designs
- 1915-1930: AZO, CYKO, VELOX marks (Kodak papers)
- 1930-1950: Various designs continue

**Paper Stock Marks**:
- AZO (triangle patterns indicate date)
- VELOX
- KRUXO
- CYKO
- DARKO
- EKC (Eastman Kodak Company)

Collectors have documented these marks extensively—research available online.

## Common Damage Types

Real photo postcards face specific preservation challenges.

### Photograph Deterioration

**Silver-Based Issues**:
- Silver mirroring (metallic sheen)
- Fading and yellowing
- Foxing spots
- Image degradation
- Contrast loss

**Environmental Damage**:
- Water stains
- Humidity damage
- Mold or mildew
- Insect damage
- Light fading

### Postcard-Specific Damage

**Postal Handling**:
- Corner damage from sorting
- Creases from mailboxes
- Stamp-related stains
- Postmark ink spreading
- Writing affecting image

**Collection Damage**:
- Album adhesive residue
- Corner mount damage
- Rubber band marks
- Stacking pressure marks
- Handling wear

## Restoration Techniques

### Scanning Real Photo Postcards

**Best Practices**:
- 600 DPI minimum for restoration
- Scan both sides (historical information)
- Include entire card in scan
- Don't crop stamps or postmarks
- Note any writing or marks

**For Damaged Items**:
- Don't force flat if curled
- Support fragile items
- Multiple angle lighting if needed
- Consider professional scanning

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I know if my old postcard is a real photo?**

Short answer: Look at the image closely, ideally with magnification. Real photo postcards show continuous photographic tones with no dot pattern. Printed postcards display a halftone dot pattern when magnified. The paper surface also differs—photo paper vs. printed cardstock.

**Are real photo postcards valuable?**

Short answer: Values range widely. Common portraits might sell for $5-20, while rare subjects (disasters, occupational scenes, identified locations, transportation) can bring $50-500+. Condition, subject matter, and rarity determine value. Get appraisals for potentially valuable items.

**How can I date a real photo postcard?**

Short answer: Check for postmarks (exact date), examine the stamp box style on back (different eras had specific designs), look for paper manufacturer marks (AZO triangles, etc.), and study fashion/technology in the image. Multiple clues together provide accurate dating.

**Can I still mail real photo postcards?**

Short answer: Physically yes, but don't mail valuable originals—they'll be damaged. For sentimental sending, create reproductions. Modern photo printing services can create postcard reproductions from scans of originals, preserving the original while sharing the image.

**Should I remove stamps from real photo postcards?**

Short answer: No—the stamps and postmarks are part of the historical record and add value to RPPCs. They date the image precisely, show postal routes, and connect to postal history collectors. Removing stamps damages the card and reduces both historical and monetary value.
