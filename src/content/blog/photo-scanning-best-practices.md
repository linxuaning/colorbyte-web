| 8x10" | 600 | Print same size or larger |
| Larger than 8x10" | 300-600 | Same size reproduction |

**Purpose-Based DPI**:
- **Web/Screen Viewing Only**: 300 DPI sufficient
- **Standard Printing**: 600 DPI recommended
- **Large Format Printing**: 900-1200 DPI
- **Archival/Future-Proofing**: 1200-2400 DPI
- **Restoration Work**: 1200+ DPI (captures fine detail)

**Important**: Use scanner's optical resolution, not interpolated resolution.

### Color Mode and Bit Depth

**Color Mode Options**:

1. **48-bit Color** (16-bit per RGB channel):
   - Best: Maximum color information
   - Use for: Color photos, archival scans
   - File Size: Largest
   - Future restoration: Best potential

2. **24-bit Color** (8-bit per channel):
   - Good: Standard quality
   - Use for: Everyday scanning, web use
   - File Size: Moderate
   - Adequate for most purposes

3. **Grayscale** (8-bit or 16-bit):
   - Use for: True black & white photos
   - Note: Scan B&W photos in color to capture toning

4. **Line Art/Black & White** (1-bit):
   - Use for: Documents, line drawings
   - Never use for photographs

**Recommendation**: Scan all photographs in 48-bit color, even black and white photos (captures yellowing, sepia tones).

### File Formats

**Format Comparison**:

| Format | Quality | File Size | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| TIFF (Uncompressed) | Excellent | Very Large | Archival master |
| TIFF (LZW Compressed) | Excellent | Large | Archival (space-saving) |
| PNG | Excellent | Large | Lossless, web-compatible |
| JPEG (Max Quality) | Very Good | Small | Sharing, web use |
| JPEG (Standard) | Good | Very Small | Email, social media |
| RAW/DNG | Excellent | Large | Film scans (if available) |

**Recommended Workflow**:
1. **Master Scan**: TIFF uncompressed (archival copy)
2. **Working Copy**: PNG or TIFF LZW (editing/restoration)
3. **Sharing Copy**: JPEG high quality (distribution)

**Never Use**:
- Compressed formats for master scans
- JPEG for archival purposes
- Low-quality settings for irreplaceable photos

### Scanner Software Settings

**Settings to Adjust**:

**1. Color Correction**:
- Set to: OFF/Manual
- Why: You'll adjust colors in editing software

**2. Sharpening**:
- Set to: OFF
- Why: Better control in editing software
- Scanner sharpening often creates halos

**3. Descreening** (Halftone Reduction):
- Set to: OFF for photos
- Set to: ON for newspaper clippings, yearbook pages
- Why: Reduces dot patterns from printed materials

**4. Dust and Scratch Removal** (ICE, Digital ICE, FARE):
- Set to: ON if available and scanning prints
- Set to: ON for film scanning
- Why: Saves restoration time
- Exception: Some Kodachrome films don't work with ICE

**5. Automatic Exposure**:
- Set to: OFF for consistency
- Set to: ON for initial test scan
- Adjust manually for best results

**6. Color Space**:
- Set to: Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB
- Avoid: sRGB (smaller color space)
- Why: Maximum color information

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What DPI should I use for scanning old family photos?

For most family photos, scan at 600-1200 DPI. Small photos (wallet size) benefit from higher resolution (1200-2400 DPI) to enable larger prints. Very large photos (8x10"+) can be scanned at 600 DPI. For archival purposes or maximum restoration potential, err on the higher side. Remember: you can always reduce resolution later, but you can't add detail that wasn't captured initially.

### Should I scan photos in color even if they're black and white?

Yes, always scan black and white photos using color mode (48-bit color). This captures yellowing, sepia toning, and subtle color casts that contain valuable information for restoration. You can convert to true grayscale later if desired, but you can't recover color information if you scan in grayscale mode. Color scans provide maximum flexibility for future enhancement.

### Is it better to scan photos myself or use a scanning service?

This depends on your collection size, budget, time, and quality requirements. DIY scanning gives you control, saves money for large collections (500+ photos), and allows immediate access. Professional services save time, provide consistent quality, and make sense for small collections (under 100 photos) or if you lack equipment. Consider a hybrid approach: scan priority photos yourself, send remainder to service. Never send irreplaceable photos without adequate insurance.

### How long does it take to scan a photo collection?

Scanning speed varies based on equipment, resolution, and workflow. Budget 2-3 minutes per photo including handling, positioning, scanning, and verification. At 600 DPI, scanning alone takes 30-60 seconds per photo. For large collections, expect 20-30 photos per hour initially, improving to 40-50 with practice. A collection of 500 photos might take 15-25 hours spread over several weeks.

### What should I do with original photos after scanning?

Always keep original photographs. Even after high-quality scanning, originals have historical value and may be needed for future re-scanning as technology improves. Store originals properly: individual archival sleeves, acid-free boxes, climate-controlled environment (65-70°F, 30-40% humidity), dark storage. Treat scans as backups of originals, not replacements. For very damaged photos, consider professional conservation after scanning to preserve what remains.
