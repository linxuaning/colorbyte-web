## Frequently Asked Questions

**How can photo restoration help identify unknown ancestors?**

Short answer: Restoration reveals facial features, clothing details, and background elements obscured by damage or fading. Clearer images are much easier for elderly relatives to identify and for researchers to date using fashion and photography style.

**Should I restore photos before uploading to genealogy sites?**

Short answer: Yes, restored photos are more useful for research and more likely to help others identify connections. Sites like Ancestry and FindAGrave display better with enhanced images. Keep originals archived as well.

**Can AI help identify the time period of an old photograph?**

Short answer: While AI doesn't date photos directly, restoration reveals details that help with dating—clothing styles, photography format characteristics, and background elements. Genealogists can then use these details for period identification.

**How do I organize a large collection of restored family photos?**

Short answer: Create a folder structure by family line and generation. Use consistent naming (Surname_FirstName_Year). Add metadata and link to genealogy software. Consider cloud storage for backup and sharing with family researchers.
