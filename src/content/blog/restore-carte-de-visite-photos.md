## Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I date a carte de visite photograph?**

Short answer: Examine card style (rounded vs. square corners, card thickness), back design (elaborate designs suggest 1870s-1880s), and fashion in the image. Photographer information combined with city directories can pinpoint dates precisely. Multiple clues usually needed for accurate dating.

**Why are albumen cartes de visite so yellow?**

Short answer: Albumen prints (made with egg white) yellow naturally over time due to chemical instability. This is inherent to the process and very common in cartes from the 1860s-1880s. Digital restoration can effectively correct this yellowing. Our [enhancement tool](/enhance-old-photos) handles this well.

**Should I remove cartes de visite from their card mounts?**

Short answer: No—never separate photo from mount. The mount is part of the historical artifact and may contain valuable information (photographer's name, location, date clues). Separation can damage both components. Scan the complete item together.

**How do I find out who is in my carte de visite photos?**

Short answer: Look for writing on backs, compare to other family photos, research the photographer's location for geographic clues, and use fashion for dating. Share with family members who may recognize subjects. DNA testing combined with known photos sometimes helps identify ancestors.

**Are carte de visite photographs valuable?**

Short answer: Most common portraits have modest value ($5-50), but subjects, condition, and photographer affect prices significantly. Civil War soldiers, celebrities, outdoor scenes, and occupational images command higher prices. Identified subjects and rare photographers increase value.
