Restoring old photos digitally is rewarding, but the real magic happens when you hold a beautiful print of a photo you thought was lost to time. Proper preparation ensures your restored photos print beautifully.

Ready to print restored photos? Our [AI photo restoration tool](/restore-old-family-photos) prepares images for high-quality printing.

## Understanding Print Requirements

### Resolution Basics

**DPI (Dots Per Inch):**
- 300 DPI: Standard photo quality
- 240 DPI: Acceptable minimum
- 150 DPI: Noticeable quality loss
- Below 150 DPI: Pixelated prints

### Size and Resolution Math

| Print Size | Pixels Needed (300 DPI) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 4×6 inches | 1200 × 1800 |
| 5×7 inches | 1500 × 2100 |
| 8×10 inches | 2400 × 3000 |
| 11×14 inches | 3300 × 4200 |
| 16×20 inches | 4800 × 6000 |

Our [AI photo upscaler](/ai-photo-upscaler) adds resolution for larger prints.

## Restoration for Printing

### Color Accuracy

Our [AI photo enhancer](/enhance-old-photos) corrects colors for print accuracy:

**What We Fix:**
- Faded colors → Restored vibrancy
- Color casts → Neutral balance
- Contrast issues → Proper tonal range
- White point → Clean highlights

### Print-Specific Considerations

**Brightness:**
- Prints often appear darker than screens
- Slightly brighten images for printing
- Test print before ordering multiples

**Color Space:**
- sRGB for most photo printing
- Adobe RGB for professional printing
- Check printer's recommendations

## Preparing Your Image

### Resolution Check

1. Open restored image
2. Check pixel dimensions
3. Calculate DPI for desired print size
4. Upscale if needed before printing

### File Format

**For Printing:**
- JPEG: Most common, widely accepted
- TIFF: Higher quality, larger files
- PNG: Good quality, some printers don't accept

### Cropping for Print

**Standard Ratios:**
- 4×6: 2:3 ratio (most common)
- 5×7: 5:7 ratio
- 8×10: 4:5 ratio (different from 4×6)

Consider how cropping affects composition when sizing for different print dimensions.

| Metallic | Modern, dramatic effect |

### Framing Restored Photos

**Protection:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What resolution do I need to print a restored photo at 8×10?**

Short answer: You need 2400 × 3000 pixels minimum for 300 DPI quality at 8×10 inches. If your restored image is smaller, our [upscaler](/ai-photo-upscaler) can enlarge it while adding natural detail for quality printing.

**Why do my printed photos look darker than on screen?**

Short answer: Screens emit light while prints reflect it, making prints appear darker. Increase brightness by 10-15% before printing, or use a calibrated monitor. Test print before ordering multiple copies of important restorations.

**Should I print restored photos at home or use a service?**

Short answer: Professional printing services typically produce better quality than home printers. For important restorations, use a quality photo service. Home printing works for quick proofs and everyday photos.

**How do I choose between glossy and matte paper?**

Short answer: Glossy shows more color and detail but reflects light and shows fingerprints. Matte is more elegant and glare-free but slightly less vibrant. Lustre (semi-gloss) offers a good compromise for most restored photos.
