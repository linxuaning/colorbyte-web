## Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I tell if my photo is from the Edwardian era?**

Short answer: Look for fashion clues (Gibson Girl hairstyles, S-bend silhouettes for women; high starched collars for men), mount styles (cabinet cards were still common but declining), and photographer stamps which may include dates. The period 1901-1910 has distinctive styles that experts can identify.

**Is it safe to remove Edwardian photos from their mounts?**

Short answer: Generally not recommended. The photo may be adhered to the mount and removal could cause damage. Additionally, the mount may contain historical information (photographer's name, location, date). Scan the photo in place. If removal is necessary for conservation, consult a professional.

**Why do my Edwardian photos have a shiny metallic look in dark areas?**

Short answer: This is silver mirroring, caused by silver ions migrating to the surface over decades. It's very common in gelatin silver prints from this era. Physical removal damages the photo, but digital restoration can effectively correct the appearance. Our [enhancement tool](/enhance-old-photos) handles silver mirroring well.

**Can colorized Edwardian photos be historically accurate?**

Short answer: Reasonably so, with research. Fashion colors, skin tones, and common items can be researched using period advertisements, surviving textiles, and historical records. Our [colorization tool](/colorize-photos-free) uses AI trained on historical references. Always note that colorized images are interpretive.

**How should I store valuable Edwardian photographs?**

Short answer: Use acid-free archival materials—folders, boxes, and interleaving tissue. Maintain stable temperature (65-70°F) and humidity (30-40%). Store flat, never rolled. Keep away from light. Consider professional archival storage for valuable pieces. Always create digital backups.
