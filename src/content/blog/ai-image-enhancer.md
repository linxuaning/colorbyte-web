# AI Image Enhancer: 7 Tools Tested in 2026 (With Real Before/After Results)

My brother called me last Thanksgiving with a request I've heard a hundred times: "David, you're the photo guy — can you fix this?"

He'd found a photo in our parents' attic. Our grandfather, maybe 1962, holding a fish he was clearly very proud of. The photo had spent sixty years folded inside a birthday card: a crease bisected his face, the whole image had that flat grey haze of oxidation, and the resolution was barely enough to make out his expression. My brother wanted to print it large and frame it for our mom's birthday.

I said sure. Then I spent two evenings testing every AI image enhancer I could find on that one photo and a batch of forty others — old scans, blurry phone shots, compressed social media downloads, and recent portraits taken in bad light. I wanted real answers, not marketing claims.

This article is what I found.

I'll be upfront: I went in skeptical. I've spent years shooting and editing professionally, and I've watched a lot of "AI-powered" tools promise the moon and deliver a mediocre Instagram filter. Some of what I found confirmed that skepticism. But some of it genuinely surprised me — including which tool handled our grandfather's photo best.

<h2>How I Tested These Tools</h2>

<p>I used a consistent test batch of 40 photos across four categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Old family photo scans</strong> (10 photos, 1940s–1990s, various damage types: fading, scratches, water stains, silver mirroring)</li>
  <li><strong>Modern blurry phone photos</strong> (10 photos, hand-shake blur and low-light noise from iPhone and Android cameras)</li>
  <li><strong>Low-resolution images</strong> (10 photos, small JPEG thumbnails, social media downloads, old digital camera shots from early 2000s)</li>
  <li><strong>Portrait close-ups</strong> (10 photos, various ages, skin tones, and lighting conditions)</li>
</ul>

<p>I scored each tool's output on five criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Sharpness recovery</strong> — Did blurry areas come back crisp without looking plastic?</li>
  <li><strong>Face quality</strong> — Did faces look natural and true-to-life?</li>
  <li><strong>Damage handling</strong> — For old photos: scratch removal, fade correction, stain repair</li>
  <li><strong>Artifact control</strong> — Did the tool introduce halos, weird textures, or color banding?</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of use</strong> — Could a non-photographer get good results without manual settings?</li>
</ol>

<p>I rated everything on a 1–10 scale and paid out of pocket for any paid tiers I needed to test thoroughly. No sponsored placements here — these are honest results from a former commercial photographer who genuinely wanted to know which tools were worth recommending to his family members.</p>

<p>One methodology note: I always uploaded the highest-quality version I had. AI enhancement is not magic — it works with what you give it. If you have multiple scans of the same photo, feed the AI the biggest, cleanest file. More on that later.</p>

<h2>The 7 AI Image Enhancers I Tested</h2>

<h3>1. ArtImageHub — Best for Old Photos and Face Enhancement</h3>

<p><a href="/old-photo-restoration">ArtImageHub</a> is specifically built for what most people actually want from an AI enhancer: rescuing old, damaged, degraded photos. The pipeline handles the full chain — global damage repair, then face enhancement, then super-resolution upscaling — in a single automated pass. You can also use our dedicated <a href="/photo-enhancer">AI Photo Enhancer</a> for quality improvement and upscaling without restoration. You upload, you wait about 30–90 seconds, you download.</p>

<p>What stood out immediately was how it handled the face work. Most general-purpose enhancers treat faces like any other region of the image. ArtImageHub applies specialized face restoration models (trained on large datasets of high-quality portraits) as a separate, dedicated step. The difference in output quality on old photos is substantial. Where other tools returned faces that looked sharp but slightly plastic, ArtImageHub preserved natural skin texture, individual hair strands, and — critically — the person's actual identity. That last point matters more than it sounds when you're restoring photos of real relatives.</p>

<p>On our grandfather's fishing photo, it was the only tool that fully handled all three problem types — the crease, the oxidation haze, and the low resolution — in a single automated pass with no adjustment needed. I'll go into detail in the head-to-head section.</p>

<p><strong>Free tier:</strong> 3 photos per day<br>
<strong>Paid tier:</strong> $9.90/month, unlimited photos<br>
<strong>Best for:</strong> Old and damaged photos, face restoration, anyone who wants professional-quality results without professional-level effort</p>

<h3>2. Topaz Photo AI — Professional Grade, Professional Price</h3>

<p>Topaz has been building AI imaging tools longer than almost anyone, and it shows. Topaz Photo AI is a desktop application (Windows and Mac) that combines their Sharpen AI, DeNoise AI, and Gigapixel AI into one interface. The results are genuinely excellent for modern photography — sharp, natural-looking noise reduction, and upscaling that holds up under close inspection.</p>

<p>Where it falls short for my purposes: it's not designed for old photo restoration. It has no scratch or damage removal. It has no dedicated face enhancement beyond general sharpening. On our old photo test batch, it improved global sharpness but left all the physical damage intact and occasionally made age-related grain look worse by interpreting it as noise to suppress. If you're a working photographer wanting to rescue poorly shot modern images, Topaz is excellent. For restoring grandma's 1955 prom portrait, it's the wrong tool.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> $199 one-time purchase (perpetual license), or ~$99/year for updates<br>
<strong>Best for:</strong> Professional photographers; modern photos; studios that need batch processing control</p>

<h3>3. Adobe Lightroom Enhance — Great for Photographers Already in the Ecosystem</h3>

<p>Lightroom's "Enhance" feature (under Photo > Enhance) has gotten meaningfully better in recent versions. The "Super Resolution" option — which analyzes the image and doubles the resolution using AI — is genuinely impressive for RAW files from modern cameras. I tested it on a batch of underexposed RAW files and the results were often comparable to Topaz at a fraction of the cost (if you're already paying for Creative Cloud).</p>

<p>The limitation is the same as Topaz: it's a photography workflow tool, not a restoration tool. It has no damage repair, no dedicated face enhancement, and it's locked inside Lightroom. If you don't already use Adobe's ecosystem, paying for Creative Cloud just to use this feature makes no sense. And for anyone trying to enhance scanned old photos rather than modern camera files, the improvement is noticeably less dramatic than tools specifically trained on degraded image types.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Included in Lightroom ($9.99–19.99/month depending on plan)<br>
<strong>Best for:</strong> Photographers already using Lightroom; modern RAW files; casual enhancement integrated into existing workflow</p>

<h3>4. Let's Enhance — Great for Pure Upscaling</h3>

<p>Let's Enhance does one thing and does it well: it makes images bigger. If you have a small, clean image (no significant damage, just low resolution) and you need it larger for print, Let's Enhance produces excellent results. Their "Magic" upscaling is genuinely impressive on product photos, landscapes, and portraits that are already reasonably clean.</p>

<p>The issue is that "upscaling" and "restoration" are different problems. Upscaling takes a clean small image and extrapolates detail. Restoration takes a damaged image and repairs it before (or while) upscaling. On damaged old photos, Let's Enhance produces sharp output that still contains all the original scratches and fading, just bigger. That's not what most people need from "enhancement."</p>

<p>That said, if you have a small-but-clean old scan, the workflow of using ArtImageHub for restoration and Let's Enhance for a final upscale pass can produce excellent results. They solve different problems.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (5 credits) then ~$9–19/month<br>
<strong>Best for:</strong> Pure upscaling; clean images that just need more pixels; print preparation</p>

<h3>5. Remini — Mobile-Focused, Limited on Desktop</h3>

<p>Remini is probably the most-downloaded AI photo app in the world, which tells you something about its ease of use. The mobile app is genuinely good for a specific purpose: enhancing blurry face photos taken on a phone. Take a blurry photo of your kid at a school play? Remini will sharpen that face impressively well. It's fast, free for basic use, and requires zero technical knowledge.</p>

<p>The limitation becomes apparent when you move outside that sweet spot. Old photo restoration is mediocre — Remini doesn't do damage repair and its face enhancement occasionally introduces a distinctly "AI-generated" smoothness that looks off. The desktop web version lacks many features from the mobile app. And it's essentially only good for faces — landscapes, objects, and backgrounds get noticeably less attention from its algorithms.</p>

<p>I also found it too aggressive on skin. Several test portraits came back with skin that looked poreless and slightly waxy — the classic beauty filter effect. That's a stylistic choice, not enhancement. On old photos of relatives, it's exactly the wrong choice.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free with limits; $9.99/month for premium<br>
<strong>Best for:</strong> Quick face sharpening on phone photos; casual users who want simple, fast results on portraits</p>

<h3>6. Google Photos — Convenient but Basic</h3>

<p>If your photos are already in Google Photos, the built-in "Enhance" button is a reasonable first pass. It applies automatic adjustments — exposure, contrast, sharpness, color balance — using AI analysis. For modern phone photos in average conditions, it often improves them noticeably with one tap.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call it an AI image enhancer in the same category as the others on this list. It doesn't do super-resolution upscaling. It doesn't do damage repair. The improvements are real but incremental — comparable to what a good "Auto" adjustment in any editing app would do. It's the difference between a tune-up and an overhaul. Useful if you just want a quick fix and the photo is already in Google's ecosystem. Not sufficient if the photo needs real work.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (included with Google account)<br>
<strong>Best for:</strong> Quick automatic improvement of modern photos already in Google Photos; no-effort casual fixes</p>

<h3>7. Luminar Neo — Creative, Not Restoration-Focused</h3>

<p>Luminar Neo gets included on a lot of "AI photo enhancer" lists because its AI tools are genuinely impressive — but they're impressive in the wrong direction for our purposes. Features like AI Sky Replacement, Relight AI, and the portrait mood tools are excellent for creative photo editing. If you want to make a dramatic landscape shot more dramatic, Luminar Neo is brilliant.</p>

<p>But it's a creative enhancement tool, not a restoration tool. It does not repair damage. It has no scratch or stain removal. Its face work is aimed at making portraits look stylistically better (smoother skin, brighter eyes, more "professional" lighting), not at recovering damaged historical photos. Using it on an old family scan is like using a guitar amplifier to fix a recording — impressive technology pointed at a completely different problem.</p>

<p>I'm including it here because it consistently ranks in generic "AI enhancer" roundups and people keep expecting it to work on old photos. It won't. Move on.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> ~$79/year or $149 one-time<br>
<strong>Best for:</strong> Creative photography editing; sky replacement; stylistic portrait enhancement; not for restoration</p>

<h2>Head-to-Head: Old Family Photos</h2>

<p>This is where the differences got stark. I ran the same six old photos through every tool and compared results side by side. Here's what happened with three representative examples.</p>

<h3>The Grandfather Fishing Photo (1962)</h3>

<p>Three problems: a fold crease across his face, overall grey oxidation haze, and a resolution so low the background was nearly indistinguishable from noise.</p>

<p><strong>ArtImageHub</strong> handled all three in a single pass. The crease was completely removed — not softened, removed. The oxidation was corrected to natural contrast. And the face came back with enough sharpness to read his expression: a slight smirk, deeply satisfied with that fish. I showed it to my brother without telling him which tool I'd used. He called me immediately. His exact words were "how did you do that?" I told him I'd let the algorithm do it.</p>

<p><strong>Topaz Photo AI</strong> improved sharpness noticeably but left the crease intact and didn't correct the fading. It made what was there look cleaner but couldn't address what was wrong with it.</p>

<p><strong>Remini</strong> improved the face but applied an aggressive smoothing that made him look younger than he probably was at the time. The crease was partially reduced (face enhancement models sometimes handle this as a side effect) but not removed. The overall image color was unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Let's Enhance</strong> made everything bigger. The crease, the haze, and the noise were all faithfully preserved at 4× resolution. Not useful here.</p>

<p><strong>Google Photos</strong> applied an auto-adjustment that lifted shadows slightly. Marginal improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Luminar Neo and Adobe Lightroom</strong> both made some tonal improvements but left all physical damage in place. Lightroom's Super Resolution did help with the resolution issue but couldn't address restoration needs.</p>

<p><strong>Winner: ArtImageHub, by a wide margin.</strong></p>

<h3>A 1978 Color Family Portrait (Fading and Color Shift)</h3>

<p>Classic late-70s decay: the cyan dye layer had faded, giving everything a warm orange cast. The blacks had lifted to muddy brown. Four faces, two of them partially shadowed.</p>

<p>ArtImageHub correctly neutralized the color cast and recovered the black point. The faces were enhanced without looking over-processed. This is harder than it looks — correcting a dye-faded color photo requires the algorithm to understand <em>why</em> the colors shifted, not just apply a generic color balance curve.</p>

<p>Topaz and Lightroom both improved color to some degree (Lightroom's color AI is actually quite good here), but neither got the skin tones fully right. The shadowed faces remained darker and less detailed than in the ArtImageHub output.</p>

<p><strong>Winner: ArtImageHub, with Lightroom Enhance as a respectable second for photographers willing to manually tweak.</strong></p>

<h3>A 1950s Black-and-White Portrait with Scratches</h3>

<p>Heavy scratches across the background, moderate cracking in the lower third, a water stain affecting one corner. One face, well-lit and large in frame.</p>

<p>ArtImageHub removed the scratches cleanly and handled the water stain well. The face came through at what I'd estimate as 4× the original apparent resolution — pores, eyebrows, the texture of a wool jacket all legible. The water stain area had some soft reconstruction but no hallucinated details that weren't there.</p>

<p>Remini, interestingly, did competitive face work here because the face was large and well-lit in the original. But background damage was ignored entirely. The result was a beautifully restored face floating in a still-damaged background — uncanny valley for family photos.</p>

<p><strong>Winner: ArtImageHub, with Remini second specifically on the face.</strong></p>

<h2>Head-to-Head: Modern Blurry Photos</h2>

<p>The leaderboard shuffled for modern phone photography. Here, the question is blur reduction and noise control — not damage repair.</p>

<p>On hand-shake blurred phone photos, <strong>Topaz Photo AI</strong> was the clear leader. Its motion blur deconvolution is genuinely impressive and produces results that look naturally sharp rather than artificially sharpened. If you're a photographer trying to rescue a blurry shot from an important event, Topaz is the tool.</p>

<p><strong>Remini</strong> was strong specifically on blurry face close-ups — its core use case. For a blurry phone portrait, it often matched or exceeded Topaz.</p>

<p><strong>ArtImageHub</strong> performed well on noise and mild blur, though it's less optimized for motion blur correction than Topaz. For blurry modern phone shots, it's a solid option — especially if you also want the face enhancement — but Topaz is the specialist.</p>

<p><strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong> was competitive for RAW files from dedicated cameras. For phone JPEGs, less so.</p>

<p>For this category specifically, my recommendation changes by use case: Topaz for motion blur on important modern shots, Remini for blurry phone portraits, ArtImageHub if the photo has both blur and face quality issues.</p>

<h2>What AI Image Enhancement Actually Does</h2>

<p>Before getting to recommendations, it's worth understanding what's happening under the hood — because it explains why different tools excel at different tasks.</p>

<h3>Super Resolution Explained Simply</h3>

<p>When you ask an AI to upscale an image, it isn't just stretching pixels and blurring the joins the way Photoshop's Bicubic did in 2003. Modern super-resolution models (the dominant one is called Real-ESRGAN) were trained on millions of pairs of high-resolution and deliberately degraded low-resolution images. The model learned to predict what high-resolution detail <em>should</em> look like given a low-resolution input.</p>

<p>The critical word is "predict." It's generating plausible detail, not recovering real detail that was there. For most uses this is fine — the predicted texture looks convincing and prints beautifully. For archival or forensic purposes, it matters that what looks like a sharp brick wall was partly invented by the algorithm.</p>

<h3>Face Enhancement (GFPGAN and How It Works)</h3>

<p>Face enhancement models like GFPGAN (developed by Tencent's research team) are trained specifically on faces. They learn the structural relationships between facial features — how eyes, nose, and mouth relate to each other, what realistic skin texture looks like, how light falls across different facial geometries. When presented with a damaged or degraded face, the model uses these structural priors to reconstruct it.</p>

<p>This is why specialized face enhancement produces dramatically better results than general-purpose sharpening on faces. A general model treats a face like any other image region — looking for edges and textures to sharpen. A face model understands it's looking at a face and uses that structural knowledge to guide the reconstruction.</p>

<p>The risk: identity drift. If the original face is severely damaged, the model fills gaps based on its training distribution. It will reconstruct <em>a</em> face, not necessarily <em>the</em> face. Always compare the output to the original and flag anything that looks "not quite right" about who the person is.</p>

<h3>Noise Reduction</h3>

<p>AI noise reduction (tools like Topaz DeNoise AI) works differently from traditional methods like Luminance noise reduction in Lightroom. Traditional methods blur the noisy pixels — which reduces noise but also softens real detail. AI noise reduction models were trained to distinguish between noise patterns and real image structure. They suppress noise while preserving fine detail like fabric texture, individual hairs, and fine type. The difference is visible and significant for high-ISO photography.</p>

<h2>Which Tool Should You Use?</h2>

<p>Based on all forty test photos, here's my honest use-case breakdown:</p>

<p>The clear pattern: if the photo is old, damaged, or has faces that need enhancement, ArtImageHub is the right tool. For modern photography problems (blur, noise, upscaling), Topaz or Lightroom win depending on your workflow.</p>

<h2>How to Get the Best Results from AI Enhancement</h2>

<p>Even the best AI enhancer is only as good as what you give it. Here's what I've learned after testing forty photos across seven tools:</p>

<h3>Start with the Cleanest Version You Have</h3>

<p>For old photos, this means scanning them yourself rather than photographing them on a phone. A flat-bed scanner at 600 DPI will give you far more information to work with than a phone camera shot of the same print — and more information means better AI output. Use TIFF or PNG format, not JPEG, which introduces compression artifacts that confuse damage-detection algorithms.</p>

<p>For digital photos, find the original file, not a social-media compressed version. That Instagram download has been compressed to maybe 15% of the original file size. Start with the phone's original HEIC or JPG file from the camera roll.</p>

<h3>Don't Over-Enhance</h3>

<p>Every AI tool has a slider or setting for enhancement strength, and the temptation is always to push it toward maximum. Resist this. Over-enhanced photos look artificial: faces go plastic, textures look painted, and the "AI look" becomes obvious. I default to 70–80% strength on face enhancement settings and only push higher if the original is severely damaged.</p>

<p>There's also a subtler problem: the more aggressively you enhance, the more the AI reconstructs rather than restores. At moderate settings, you're recovering what was there. At maximum settings, you're getting the AI's idea of what should have been there. For photos of real people, the distinction matters.</p>

<h3>When to Stop</h3>

<p>Compare the enhanced output to the original before deciding you're done. Check three things: (1) Are faces still recognizable as the same person? (2) Are there new details in the background that weren't in the original? (3) Does the overall tone and character of the photo feel right?</p>

<p>Sometimes the AI over-corrects on color — making a naturally warm old photo look cooler and more "modern." Sometimes it's over-eager about perceived scratches and softens real fine detail. When you notice these things, try downloading the result and doing a quick manual level correction in any basic editor, or try a lower enhancement strength. The AI is a powerful starting point, not the final word.</p>

<p>And if a photo is genuinely irreplaceable — the only image of a person who's gone — consider using AI as a first pass and then spending a hundred dollars to have a professional restoration artist review and touch up the result. AI gets you 85–90% of the way there. For that last 10–15% on a photo that matters most, the human touch is worth the cost.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Can AI enhance a photo that's extremely blurry or tiny?</strong><br>
<strong>Short answer:</strong> It depends on how much information survives. Small but sharp originals respond well to AI upscaling. Blurry originals are harder — AI can sharpen apparent detail but can't recover information that was never captured.</p>

<p>The practical threshold: if the main subject (especially a face) is at least 128×128 pixels in the original, modern face enhancement models have enough to work with. Below that, results become unpredictable. For old tiny prints (wallet photos, photo booth strips), scan at 1200 DPI to give the AI more pixels to analyze before enhancement.</p>

<p><strong>Will AI enhancement change how my relatives look in old photos?</strong><br>
<strong>Short answer:</strong> Modern tools are designed to preserve identity, but it's imperfect. Always compare the output to the original and flag anything that looks "not quite right" about the person.</p>

<p>Face restoration models include identity preservation in their training objectives — meaning they're penalized during training for changing who someone looks like. In practice, results are accurate 90–95% of the time. The failure cases typically involve severely damaged photos where the AI has to reconstruct from very little. If the output face doesn't look right to you, trust your instinct — you know what your relative looked like better than the algorithm does.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a difference between "AI upscaling" and "AI enhancement"?</strong><br>
<strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes. Upscaling makes an image bigger. Enhancement improves image quality by repairing damage, reducing noise, sharpening, or correcting color. The best tools do both, but they're different processes.</p>

<p>You can upscale without enhancing (Let's Enhance on a clean small photo) and you can enhance without upscaling (noise reduction on a large RAW file). For old scanned photos, you typically want both — enhancement to repair damage and correct fading, then upscaling to produce a print-ready file. Tools like ArtImageHub do this in a single pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>How much do AI image enhancers cost, and is the paid version worth it?</strong><br>
<strong>Short answer:</strong> Free tiers are worth trying before committing. For anything beyond casual use — a box of old family photos, regular photography work — paid plans at $9–20/month pay for themselves quickly.</p>

<p>Most tools offer free tiers with limited daily uses (typically 3–10 photos per day). If you're restoring a collection of old family photos, even a single month's subscription to ArtImageHub at $9.90 gets you unlimited photos — which means a box of 200 scanned prints costs about five cents each. At that price, the question isn't whether it's worth it — it's whether you have the scans ready.</p>

The grandfather's fishing photo is on my mom's wall now. Eight by ten, framed, the crease completely gone and his expression clear enough to show the smirk my brother and I apparently inherited. She cried when she opened it. My brother got full credit — which is fine.
