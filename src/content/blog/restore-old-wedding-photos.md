## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can you restore a wedding photo where the bride's dress has turned yellow?**

Short answer: Yes, this is one of the most common wedding photo issues and responds well to restoration. Our [AI restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) specifically addresses yellowing in white fabrics, restoring the dress to its original bright white while maintaining natural texture and detail.

**How do you restore wedding photos with multiple people where some faces are blurry?**

Short answer: AI face enhancement works on each face individually, so clearer faces stay sharp while blurry faces are enhanced as much as possible. Results vary by blur severity, but even moderate improvement makes group photos more enjoyable. Our tool processes all faces automatically.

**Can black and white wedding photos be colorized accurately?**

Short answer: Yes, AI colorization produces natural-looking results for wedding photos. Skin tones, common dress colors, and typical wedding settings colorize well. The AI makes educated guesses based on context—exact original colors aren't guaranteed, but results are realistic and beautiful.

**What resolution should I scan old wedding photos?**

Short answer: Scan at minimum 600 DPI for standard prints, 1200 DPI for important portraits you might enlarge. Higher resolution gives our [AI upscaler](/ai-photo-upscaler) more information to work with, producing better restoration results especially for large prints.

**Should I restore the original wedding photo or work from a copy?**

Short answer: Always work from a high-quality scan—never alter original physical photos. Digital restoration is non-destructive and reversible. Keep the original stored safely, and create your restored versions digitally. This preserves the original while giving you enhanced versions.
