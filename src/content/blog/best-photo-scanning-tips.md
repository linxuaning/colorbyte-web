Quality restoration starts with quality scanning. The better your scan, the better your AI restoration results. This guide covers everything you need to know about scanning old photos for optimal enhancement.

Ready to restore? Our [AI photo restoration tool](/restore-old-family-photos) works best with properly scanned photos.

## Scanner Selection

### Types of Scanners

**Flatbed Scanners:**
- Best for prints and documents
- Most versatile option
- $50-500 range

**Film Scanners:**
- Dedicated to negatives and slides
- Higher resolution for film
- $200-1000 range

**All-in-One Printers:**
- Convenient but lower quality
- Acceptable for basic needs
- Not recommended for archival work

### Recommended Settings

| Photo Type | Minimum DPI | Ideal DPI |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Standard prints | 300 | 600 |
| Small prints (wallet) | 600 | 1200 |
| Damaged photos | 600 | 1200 |
| 35mm negatives | 2400 | 4000 |
| Slides | 2400 | 4000 |

## Pre-Scanning Preparation

### Cleaning Photos

**Do:**
- Use soft, lint-free cloth
- Remove loose debris gently
- Clean scanner glass thoroughly

**Don't:**
- Use liquid cleaners on photos
- Rub damaged surfaces
- Handle photo surfaces directly

### Handling Fragile Photos

- Wear cotton gloves
- Support photos from below
- Never force flat photos that have curled
- Consider professional scanning for very fragile items

## Scanning Settings

### File Formats

**TIFF (Recommended):**
- Lossless quality
- Best for archival
- Larger file size
- Use for master scans

**JPEG:**
- Smaller file size
- Some quality loss
- Acceptable for sharing
- Not ideal for further editing

### Color Settings

**Scanning Mode:**
- Color photos: Color mode
- B&W photos: Grayscale (not B&W)
- Documents: Grayscale or B&W

**Bit Depth:**
- 24-bit for color (minimum)
- 48-bit for color (ideal)
- 8-bit for grayscale
- 16-bit for grayscale (ideal)

### Auto-Correction Settings

**Turn OFF:**
- Auto color correction
- Auto contrast
- Auto sharpening
- Dust removal (for most scans)

Let our [AI photo enhancer](/enhance-old-photos) handle corrections—scanner auto-adjustments often cause problems.

## Scanning Techniques

### Standard Prints

1. Clean scanner glass
2. Place photo face-down, aligned with edge
3. Preview scan and adjust crop
4. Scan at 600 DPI minimum
5. Save as TIFF

### Damaged Photos

For photos needing restoration:
- Scan at higher DPI (1200)
- Include all edges and damage
- Don't try to correct during scan
- Keep as much detail as possible

### Multiple Photos

**Batch Scanning Tips:**
- Group photos of similar size
- Leave space between photos
- Use scanner software to split
- Name files consistently

## After Scanning

### File Organization

**Naming Convention:**
- Date_Subject_Number.tiff
- Example: 1965_Wedding_001.tiff

**Folder Structure:**
- By decade or era
- By family branch
- By event type

### Backup Strategy

- Keep originals on separate drive
- Use cloud backup
- Store copies in different location
- Never edit original scans

Our [AI photo upscaler](/ai-photo-upscaler) can enlarge well-scanned photos for printing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What DPI should I use for old photos I want to restore?**

Short answer: Scan at 600 DPI minimum for standard prints, 1200 DPI for small or damaged photos. Higher resolution gives AI more data to work with. You can always downsize later, but you can't add detail that wasn't scanned.

**Should I use my scanner's auto-correction features?**

Short answer: No, turn them off. Scanner auto-corrections often over-correct and remove detail that AI restoration needs. Scan raw, then let our [restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) handle enhancement properly.

**Can I scan photos with my phone camera?**

Short answer: Phone scanning is acceptable for quick sharing but not ideal for restoration. Use a scanning app for proper alignment. For best results and archival quality, use a dedicated flatbed scanner.

**How do I scan photos that are stuck in albums?**

Short answer: If photos are in slip-in albums, remove them carefully. For photos stuck to pages, scan with the page if removal risks damage. Consider professional help for valuable stuck photos.
