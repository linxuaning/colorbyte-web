## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can severely faded 1970s prom dress colors be restored?**

Short answer: Yes, often dramatically. 1970s color photos commonly suffer magenta or yellow shifts, but the underlying image data often survives. Our [enhancement tool](/enhance-old-photos) can correct color casts and restore vibrancy. Results can be remarkable—faded pastels become distinct colors again.

**How do I restore a prom photo where the dress was a specific color I remember?**

Short answer: If you remember the original color, that information helps guide restoration. Our AI tool works automatically, but for specific color matching, minor adjustments may be needed. Let us know the remembered color, and restoration can prioritize that accuracy.

**Can motion-blurred dance floor photos be improved?**

Short answer: To some extent. AI can sharpen slightly blurred images and enhance detail, but severe motion blur has physical limits. We can improve visibility and reduce blur effects, making dance photos more viewable, though they won't match the sharpness of posed portraits.

**Should I restore prom photos where the couple is no longer together?**

Short answer: Consider the photo's value beyond the relationship. It still documents your (or a family member's) youth, fashion of the era, and a milestone event. You could restore it for the individual, or restore and crop to focus on one person. The memory remains meaningful regardless of subsequent relationships.

**How do I find prom photos of deceased relatives?**

Short answer: Check school yearbooks, which often included prom photos. Ask other family members who might have copies. School districts sometimes retain archives. Local historical societies may have community event photos. Classmates from that year might share copies.
