## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can AI restore a military photo where the uniform details are faded?**

Short answer: Yes, AI restoration is particularly good at enhancing uniform details because military uniforms follow consistent patterns the AI can recognize. Our [restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) recovers faded insignia, patches, and uniform textures while maintaining historical accuracy.

**How do I restore a WWII photo that's been folded and carried for years?**

Short answer: Fold lines and wear from carrying are common in WWII photos. Our AI handles these creases well—the restoration process identifies fold damage and repairs it while preserving the underlying image. Results are usually excellent for this common damage type.

**Can you colorize old military photos accurately?**

Short answer: AI colorization produces realistic results for military photos. Uniform colors are fairly standardized by era and branch, so colorization is often quite accurate. Skin tones and backgrounds also colorize naturally. Our [colorization tool](/colorize-photos-free) handles military photos well.

**Should I donate original military photos after restoration?**

Short answer: Keep originals in your family while sharing high-quality digital copies with historical societies, museums, or veteran organizations. Restored digital versions preserve the memory while originals remain family heirlooms. Many organizations accept digital donations.

**How do I restore a photo of a group of soldiers where some faces are unclear?**

Short answer: Our AI enhances each face to the extent possible given original clarity. Clearer faces improve significantly; blurry faces improve within physical limits. Group military photos often show excellent improvement because formal poses typically meant steady subjects.
