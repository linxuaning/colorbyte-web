## Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I find out what unit my WWII relative served in?**

Short answer: Start with any visible uniform details like shoulder patches. Request official records from NPRC (National Personnel Records Center). Search Ancestry.com's WWII collections for enlistment records and unit rosters. Fold3.com has extensive WWII military documents. Morning reports can track individual soldiers through their service.

**Were the 1973 fire records all destroyed for WWII Army personnel?**

Short answer: No—the 1973 National Archives fire destroyed about 80% of Army records for personnel discharged between 1912-1964, but many records survive. Records for officers, Navy/Marines, and those discharged after 1963 were in different locations. Alternative sources (unit records, VA files, state archives) often provide information.

**Can WWII photos be colorized accurately?**

Short answer: Yes, with research. WWII uniform colors are well-documented—olive drab, khaki, navy blue, etc. Official color charts and surviving uniforms provide references. Our [colorization tool](/colorize-photos-free) uses accurate military colors. Some variation existed, so colorization is informed interpretation.

**How do I restore WWII photos damaged by humidity in the Pacific?**

Short answer: Pacific Theater photos often suffered tropical humidity damage—foxing, mold spots, and stuck photos. Our [AI restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) effectively removes spots and stains. For physically stuck photos, see our guide on separating stuck photographs. Digital restoration can dramatically improve appearance.

**Are WWII photographs valuable to collectors?**

Short answer: Values vary greatly. Common portraits bring $5-30. More valuable: combat images, identified soldiers with research potential, African American units, women's services, specific battles/locations, and photographs with documents. Professional appraisal recommended for potentially significant items.
