Newspaper clippings often contain the only photographs of historic events, announcements, and family milestones. These newsprint images present unique restoration challenges due to halftone printing patterns and paper yellowing.

Have newspaper photos to restore? Our [AI photo restoration tool](/restore-old-family-photos) can enhance images from newsprint sources.

## Newspaper Photo Challenges

### Halftone Patterns

Newspapers print using dot patterns that create visual noise when scanned. Modern AI can help reduce this pattern while preserving image detail.

### Paper Deterioration

**Common Issues:**
- Severe yellowing
- Brittle, torn edges
- Foxing spots
- Ink bleeding

Our [AI photo enhancer](/enhance-old-photos) addresses newsprint-specific deterioration.

## Best Results from Newsprint

### Scanning Tips

- Scan at 600+ DPI
- Use descreen feature if available
- Keep clipping flat
- Clean scanner glass

### What AI Can Improve

| Issue | Improvement |
|-------|-------------|
| Halftone dots | Moderate reduction |
| Yellowing | Excellent correction |
| Low contrast | Good enhancement |
| Face clarity | Noticeable improvement |
