## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can all faces in a large reunion photo be enhanced?**

Short answer: Yes, our [AI restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) processes the entire image, enhancing all faces simultaneously. Quality improves across the photo, though faces closer to the camera will show more detail than those further away—this reflects the original capture.

**How do I restore a reunion photo where some people are in shadow?**

Short answer: AI restoration can balance lighting, lifting shadows while maintaining highlight detail. People in shade become more visible without overexposing those in sun. Complete balance isn't always possible, but significant improvement typically is.

**What if I have multiple copies of a reunion photo in different conditions?**

Short answer: Start with the best quality original. If different copies show different details clearly, restoration can potentially combine information. Our tool works with whatever source you provide—better originals yield better results.

**How do I identify people in old reunion photos before elders pass?**

Short answer: Urgently gather identifications while knowledge exists. Create numbered diagrams of positions. Show photos to multiple family members for verification. Record relationships, not just names. Document immediately—this information disappears fast.

**Can old reunion photos help with genealogy research?**

Short answer: Absolutely. They document who was alive and together at specific times, show family relationships and groupings, and often include people whose photographs may not otherwise survive. Restored photos with identifications become valuable genealogical resources.
