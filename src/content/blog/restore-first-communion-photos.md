## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can yellowed First Communion dresses be restored to white in photos?**

Short answer: Yes, effectively. Yellowing of white fabric in photographs is common and correctable. Our [AI restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) restores bright whites while preserving lace detail and natural appearance. Results are typically dramatic—dingy yellowed whites become clean and bright again.

**How do I restore a First Communion photo where the white dress has lost all detail?**

Short answer: AI restoration can recover detail that appears lost. White fabric often retains texture information even when it looks blown out. Our tool analyzes and enhances this hidden detail. Very overexposed areas have limits, but meaningful improvement is usually possible.

**Can group First Communion class photos be enhanced?**

Short answer: Yes. Our tool handles multiple faces and figures, enhancing everyone in the group while maintaining consistency. Individual faces become clearer, and the overall image quality improves. This is valuable for identifying classmates and preserving collective memories.

**Should I restore First Communion photos for family members of other faiths?**

Short answer: If restoring for the family, absolutely—these photos document meaningful childhood memories regardless of current beliefs. The restoration honors the moment as it was. If the person prefers not to emphasize religious aspects, focus on family and childhood rather than ceremony.

**How do I find First Communion photos if originals are lost?**

Short answer: Check with other family members (grandparents, godparents especially). Contact the church, which may have archives. The photographer may have records if identified. Class photos may survive even if individual portraits are lost. Parish schools sometimes keep historical photos.
