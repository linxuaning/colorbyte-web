Native American historical photographs document Indigenous peoples, cultures, and communities across generations—from early reservation-era portraits to modern family images. These photographs preserve faces, traditions, and stories that connect contemporary Native Americans to their ancestors. Restoring these images with cultural sensitivity honors both the individuals pictured and the living heritage they represent.
