## Frequently Asked Questions

**What resolution do restored photos need for Instagram?**

Short answer: Instagram displays at 1080 pixels on the longest edge. Our restoration tool produces files larger than this, giving Instagram quality source material. The platform handles resizing, but higher quality input means better output.

**Do before/after restoration posts get good engagement?**

Short answer: Yes, transformation posts often perform very well. The dramatic change from damaged to restored captures attention and generates shares. Consider posting as Instagram carousels or Facebook slideshows for maximum impact.

**Should I watermark restored family photos shared online?**

Short answer: Watermarks are optional for personal photos. If you're sharing publicly and want credit for restoration work, a subtle watermark is reasonable. For family group sharing, watermarks usually aren't necessary.

**How do I share restored photos with family who aren't on social media?**

Short answer: Create shared cloud albums (Google Photos, iCloud, Dropbox) for family members without social media. Email individual photos, or create a simple photo website. Consider printing and mailing for elderly relatives.
