School photos document our educational journey from kindergarten through graduation—annual class pictures that capture how we grew and changed over the years. When these photos fade or become damaged, restoration helps preserve these nostalgic memories that connect us to our past.

Have school photos to restore? Our [AI photo restoration tool](/restore-old-family-photos) brings faded class pictures back to life with natural, clear results.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can you restore a class photo where individual faces are very small?**

Short answer: Yes, AI enhancement can improve clarity on small faces in class photos. The improvement depends on original image quality and face size, but even moderate enhancement makes identification easier. Our tool processes each face individually for optimal results.

**How do I restore photos from a yearbook without damaging the book?**

Short answer: Place the yearbook flat on the scanner, gently press to flatten pages (don't crack the spine), and accept slight distortion near the binding. For valuable yearbooks, photograph pages instead of scanning. Our [restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) works well with either method.

**Can faded 1970s school photos with orange color casts be fixed?**

Short answer: Yes, this is extremely common and responds well to AI color correction. The distinctive warm color cast of 1970s photos fades into orange/brown tones over time. Our restoration removes the cast and restores natural colors while preserving the era's authentic look.

**What if I want to restore just my face from a class photo?**

Short answer: You can crop your face from a class photo before uploading, then restore the cropped image. Our AI will enhance that individual face. For best results, include some surrounding context when cropping, then crop tighter after restoration if needed.

**Can AI read or preserve the names printed below a class photo?**

Short answer: Yes, text in photos is preserved during restoration. The AI focuses on image enhancement and won't alter text. If names are faded but still visible in the scan, they'll remain in the restored version. Severely degraded text may still be difficult to read.
