**How do I restore photos from family still in Latin America?**

Short answer: Family members can scan and send digital copies, which you can then restore with our tool. This works well for connecting international family collections. Encourage high-resolution scans. Results can be shared back digitally.

**Can quinceañera and wedding photos from decades ago be restored?**

Short answer: Yes, these celebration photos are excellent restoration candidates. Our tool addresses fading, damage, and age effects while preserving the special details of these cultural celebrations—traditional dresses, decorations, and gathering moments.

**How do I research Latino ancestors across the U.S.-Mexico border?**

Short answer: Use both U.S. and Mexican records. FamilySearch has extensive Mexican Catholic Church records. U.S. Census, immigration, and naturalization records help. The border moved historically—some families lived in one place while the border changed around them.
