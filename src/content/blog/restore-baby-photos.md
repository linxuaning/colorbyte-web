## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can you restore a faded baby photo where the skin looks orange or yellow?**

Short answer: Yes, color correction is one of the most common baby photo fixes. Faded photos often develop orange or yellow color casts from chemical deterioration. Our [AI restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) automatically corrects these color shifts, restoring natural, healthy-looking baby skin tones.

**How do you handle baby photos where the face is blurry from movement?**

Short answer: AI enhancement can improve motion blur moderately, though severely blurred faces have limits. Our tool's face enhancement works best on slight blur from baby movement. For mildly blurry photos, results are often surprisingly good—you'll see features more clearly than the original.

**Can baby photos from the 1960s-70s with severe fading be restored?**

Short answer: Yes, even severely faded photos often restore well. The image data is still there, just faded. Our AI analyzes what remains and reconstructs colors and details. I've seen 1960s baby photos that looked completely washed out restore to beautiful, colorful images.

**Should I restore all baby photos or just the best ones?**

Short answer: Start with the most important—newborn portraits, photos with now-deceased relatives, and milestone moments. Storage is cheap; your time prioritizing matters more. Try our 3 free photos on your most precious images, then decide on the full collection.

**What if the original baby photo has writing on it—will restoration remove that?**

Short answer: AI restoration preserves the image content, including any visible writing. If writing is on the front of the photo, it remains. If you want writing removed, that requires manual editing. Our tool focuses on damage repair, not content removal.
