## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many photos should I restore for a reunion?**

Short answer: Start with 20-30 key photos covering major ancestors and events. You can always do more, but this creates a meaningful display without overwhelming. Prioritize photos of people who will be discussed or recognized.

**Can I restore photos quickly before an upcoming reunion?**

Short answer: Yes, AI restoration is fast. Our [restoration tool](/restore-old-family-photos) can process photos in minutes rather than the days traditional restoration requires. Plan a few weeks ahead for collection and printing.

**How do I create a family tree display with photos?**

Short answer: Start with your oldest photos at the top, branching down through generations. Label each photo with name, birth year, and relationship. Connect related people with lines. Large restored photos make excellent centerpieces.

**What's the best way to share restored photos after the reunion?**

Short answer: Create a shared cloud folder (Google Drive, Dropbox) and invite family members. Include both restored files and any scanned originals. This ensures the restoration work benefits the whole family, not just reunion attendees.
