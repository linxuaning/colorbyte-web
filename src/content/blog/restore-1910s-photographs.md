## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I know if my photo is from the 1910s?**

Short answer: Look for fashion clues (hobble skirts early decade, military uniforms mid-decade), mount or postcard back styles, and any written dates. Women's hats were very large until about 1914. Men's collar styles also evolved. Military photos are often dated by uniform details.

**Can WWI military photos be colorized accurately?**

Short answer: Yes, with research. WWI uniform colors are well-documented in military records and surviving examples. However, variations existed between units and over time. Our [colorization tool](/colorize-photos-free) uses historically accurate references. Always note colorized images as interpretive.

**Why are my 1910s photos so yellow?**

Short answer: Yellowing comes from acidic paper and mounting materials degrading over time, plus natural aging of the photographic paper. This is very common and can be corrected digitally. Our [enhancement tool](/enhance-old-photos) effectively removes yellowing while preserving image detail.

**Are real photo postcards from the 1910s valuable?**

Short answer: It depends on subject matter, condition, and rarity. Most common subjects have modest value, but unusual content (disasters, local scenes, occupational images) can be quite valuable. Military subjects from WWI have collector interest. Condition significantly affects value.

**How can I find out more about the people in my 1910s photos?**

Short answer: Start with family records and any writing on the photos. Use genealogy sites like Ancestry.com. For military photos, check WWI draft registrations, service records, and casualty lists. Local historical societies often have photo archives that might include your relatives.
