# I Tested 6 AI Photo Tools on 100 Family Photos—Here's What Actually Works

When my aunt asked me to restore 100 family photos for her father's 85th birthday slideshow, I had three weeks and zero budget for professional restoration (which would've cost $5,000–$15,000).

So I did what any reasonable person with a mild obsession for spreadsheets would do: I tested every major AI photo restoration tool I could find, tracked everything, and built comparison tables that my wife says are "concerning."

**The test:**
- 100 family photos from 1940–1990
- Same photos uploaded to 6 different tools
- Scored on face quality, artifact levels, color accuracy, and "would I print this?" factor
- Tracked cost, time, and annoyance level

Here's what I found.

## The Tools I Tested

1. **ArtImageHub** (web)
2. **Remini** (mobile app + web)
3. **MyHeritage Photo Enhancer** (web)
4. **Adobe Photoshop AI** (desktop)
5. **HitPaw Photo Enhancer** (desktop)
6. **VanceAI** (web)

**Disclaimer:** I have no affiliation with any of these tools. I paid for Pro plans with my own money where necessary.

## The Test Dataset (What I Was Working With)

100 photos spanning five decades:

**By era:**
- 1940s: 8 photos (black-and-white, severe yellowing, some silver mirroring)
- 1950s: 15 photos (Kodachrome slides, decent condition)
- 1960s: 22 photos (color prints, moderate fading)
- 1970s: 31 photos (Ektachrome, heavy magenta shift)
- 1980s–90s: 24 photos (Polaroids + early digital, various issues)

**By damage type:**
- Light damage (fading only): 42 photos
- Moderate damage (fading + scratches/stains): 38 photos
- Severe damage (tears, water damage, emulsion cracking): 20 photos

**Key metric:** I needed at least 50 photos print-worthy at 8×10 inches for the slideshow.

## Test Methodology

For each tool:
1. Uploaded the same set of 10 representative photos (varied eras/damage levels)
2. Used default settings first, then tried advanced settings if available
3. Measured processing time, output resolution, file size
4. Scored results on 5-point scale: Face quality, Background quality, Color accuracy, Artifact level, Overall print-worthiness
5. Calculated cost per photo based on subscription pricing

## Round 1: Face Restoration (The Most Important Part)

Faces are what people actually care about. If Grandpa's face looks wrong, nothing else matters.

### Test Photo #1: 1947 Wedding Portrait (Severe Silver Mirroring)

Original condition: Faces barely visible through metallic haze, yellowed, 400×600 pixel scan from 3×4 inch print

| Tool | Face Clarity | Skin Texture | Identity Preservation | Artifacts | Score |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------|-------|
| **ArtImageHub** | Excellent | Natural | Perfect | None visible | **4.8/5** |
| **Remini** | Excellent | Overly smooth | Very good | Slight plastic look | **4.3/5** |
| **MyHeritage** | Very good | Natural | Perfect | None | **4.5/5** |
| **Adobe AI** | Good | Inconsistent | Good | Some noise | **3.8/5** |
| **HitPaw** | Very good | Overly sharp | Good | Edge artifacts | **3.9/5** |
| **VanceAI** | Moderate | Blurry | Fair | Significant | **2.5/5** |

**Winner: ArtImageHub**

Why: Best balance of clarity and natural texture. Grandma's wrinkles were preserved (she *had* wrinkles in 1947—she was 31, not 21). Remini made everyone look 10 years younger, which is flattering but inaccurate.

**Processing time:**
- ArtImageHub: 47 seconds
- Remini (mobile): 23 seconds
- MyHeritage: 1 minute 18 seconds
- Adobe AI: 3 minutes 42 seconds (local processing)

### Test Photo #2: 1973 Family Reunion (16 faces, moderate fading)

This was the torture test—lots of faces at different distances and angles.

**Results:**
- **ArtImageHub**: Enhanced 14 of 16 faces well. Two background faces stayed blurry (fair—they were tiny in the original).
- **Remini**: Enhanced 12 of 16 faces. Introduced slight warping on 3 faces. Made skin tones too uniform.
- **MyHeritage**: Enhanced 13 of 16 faces conservatively. Safest results but least dramatic improvement.
- **Adobe AI**: Enhanced 11 of 16 faces. Some faces over-sharpened, others under-processed.

**Winner: ArtImageHub** (most faces improved successfully)

## Round 2: Color Accuracy (Black-and-White Colorization)

I tested colorization on 15 B&W photos from the 1940s–50s.

### Test Photo #3: 1952 Backyard BBQ

Original: B&W photo, grass, blue sky (I know it was blue—there's a color photo from the same day), brick house, people in casual clothes.

| Tool | Sky Color | Grass Color | Skin Tones | Clothing | Overall Realism |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **ArtImageHub** | Correct blue | Realistic green | Natural | Conservative (grays/beiges) | **4.4/5** |
| **MyHeritage** | Correct blue | Realistic green | Excellent | Conservative | **4.6/5** |
| **Remini** | Too saturated | Neon green | Orange-ish | Vibrant (unrealistic) | **3.2/5** |
| **Adobe AI** | Grayish blue | Yellow-green | Decent | Hit-or-miss | **3.5/5** |

**Winner: MyHeritage** (historically accurate colors)

**Remini's problem:** Everything looked Instagram-filtered. My aunt took one look and said "that's not how the 50s looked." She's right — 1952 shouldn't look like 2024 Valencia filter. Great for social media, terrible for authenticity.

### Colorization Accuracy Test

I had 3 photos where I knew the actual colors (matching color photos existed):

1. **1955 Chevy Bel Air** (turquoise in reality)
   - ArtImageHub: Predicted blue (close enough)
   - Remini: Predicted red (wrong)
   - MyHeritage: Predicted light blue (closest)

2. **Grandmother's dress** (navy blue in reality)
   - ArtImageHub: Predicted dark gray (conservative but not wrong)
   - Remini: Predicted teal (wrong, too saturated)
   - MyHeritage: Predicted dark blue (correct!)

3. **Living room walls** (pale yellow in reality)
   - All tools predicted beige/cream (acceptable)

**Verdict:** AI can't know specific colors. MyHeritage made the safest historically plausible guesses.

## Round 3: Processing Severe Damage

20 photos had serious problems: tears, water damage, stuck-together prints, emulsion cracks.

### Test Photo #4: 1968 Christmas (Water-damaged, 40% image loss in bottom-right corner)

**Results:**
- **ArtImageHub**: Inpainted missing area with plausible texture. Not perfect, but printable. **3.8/5**
- **Remini**: Ignored missing area—output still had blank spot. **2.0/5**
- **MyHeritage**: Partially filled missing area, some artifacts. **3.2/5**
- **Adobe AI (Generative Fill)**: Best inpainting, but required manual selection. **4.5/5** (but not automated)

**Winner: Adobe AI for severe damage** (if you have time for manual work)
**Winner: ArtImageHub for automated processing** (of severe damage)

### Test Photo #5: 1943 Military Portrait (Cracked emulsion, severe fading)

**Critical test:** This was the only photo of my great-uncle who died in WWII. No do-overs.

**Results:**
- **ArtImageHub**: Smoothed cracks, restored face, maintained period feel. **4.6/5** ✓ Would print
- **Remini**: Over-processed—looked too modern. **3.5/5** ✗ Would not print (loses historical authenticity)
- **MyHeritage**: Conservative restoration, some cracks still visible. **4.0/5** ✓ Would print
- **Adobe AI**: Required 45 minutes of manual healing brush work. **4.8/5** (but exhausting)

**Decision:** Used ArtImageHub version for the slideshow. Sent original to a professional conservator for $250 frame-worthy restoration (worth it for this one).

## Round 4: Batch Processing Speed

I needed to process 100 photos. Speed matters.

**Time to process 10 photos:**

| Tool | Time | Cost | Output Resolution | Batch Upload? |
|------|------|------|------------------|---------------|
| **ArtImageHub** | 8 minutes | $0 (free tier) | Up to 2048px | ✓ Yes (Pro) |
| **Remini** | 4 minutes | $4.99 Pro | Up to 2048px | ✓ Yes |
| **MyHeritage** | 12 minutes | $99/year | Up to 1920px | ✓ Yes |
| **Adobe AI** | 35 minutes | $54.99/month | Native resolution | ✗ No (manual) |
| **HitPaw** | 15 minutes | $19.95/month | Up to 4K | Semi (limited) |
| **VanceAI** | 9 minutes | $9.90/month | Up to 2000px | ✓ Yes |

**Winner: Remini** (fastest)
**Runner-up: ArtImageHub** (good speed, acceptable free tier)

**Real-world workflow time for 100 photos:**

| Tool | Upload Time | Processing Time | Review + Download | Total |
|------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **ArtImageHub** | 12 min | 80 min | 45 min | **2h 17min** |
| **Remini** | 8 min | 40 min | 30 min | **1h 18min** |
| **MyHeritage** | 15 min | 120 min | 60 min | **3h 15min** |

(Times include re-running failures and reviewing results)

## Round 5: Cost Reality Check

I'm paying out of pocket. Cost matters.

### Free Tier Comparison (What You Get for $0)

| Tool | Free Photos | Resolution | Watermark | Daily Limit |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **ArtImageHub** | 3/day | 720p | Small corner | Daily reset |
| **Remini** | ~5/day | HD with watermark | Large center | Varies |
| **MyHeritage** | 10/month | Full | None | Monthly |
| **Adobe AI** | ✗ No free tier | — | — | — |
| **HitPaw** | 3 photos total | Watermarked | Large | Lifetime limit |
| **VanceAI** | 3 photos total | Watermarked | Large | Lifetime limit |

**Best free tier: MyHeritage** (10 photos/month, no watermark)
**Most generous daily: ArtImageHub** (3/day = 90/month if you're patient)

### Paid Plan Cost Per Photo (Processing 100 photos)

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Photos Included | Cost Per Photo | Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **ArtImageHub Pro** | $9.00 | 100 credits | **$0.09** | Annual: $90/year |
| **Remini Pro** | $4.99 | Unlimited | **$0.05** | Best value for volume |
| **MyHeritage** | $8.25/mo | Unlimited | **$0.08** | $99 annual only |
| **Adobe Photo** | $54.99 | Unlimited | **$0.55** | Full Photoshop access |
| **HitPaw** | $19.95 | 100 photos | **$0.20** | Monthly plan |
| **VanceAI** | $9.90 | 100 credits | **$0.10** | Plus $0.50 per extra |

**Cheapest for 100 photos: Remini** ($4.99 for unlimited)
**Best value considering quality: ArtImageHub** ($9 for 100 high-quality restorations)

### My Actual Spending

For this 100-photo project:
- **Remini Pro**: $4.99 (1 month) → Used for 30 photos (mobile convenience)
- **ArtImageHub free**: $0 → Used for 45 photos over 15 days (3/day limit)
- **MyHeritage annual**: $99 → Used for 15 historical photos (kept subscription for family tree features)
- **Adobe Photoshop**: $54.99 (1 month) → Used for 5 disaster photos requiring manual work
- **Professional conservator**: $250 (1 photo—the 1943 military portrait)

**Total: $409.98** for 100 restored photos = **$4.10 per photo**

Compared to professional restoration quotes I got ($50–150 per photo), I saved $4,590–$14,590.

## Round 6: The "Would I Actually Use This?" Test

After two weeks of testing, here's what I actually kept using:

### Daily Driver: Remini (Mobile)

**Use case:** Quick fixes while sorting photos

**Why:** I'd pull out photos from storage boxes, snap them with my phone, run through Remini while still in the basement, and immediately see if they were worth scanning properly.

**Processed:** ~200 quick assessments

**Cost:** $4.99/month (canceled after project)

### Serious Restoration: ArtImageHub (Web)

**Use case:** After scanning, for photos destined for the slideshow

**Why:** Best face restoration, natural results, processed severe damage well

**Processed:** 45 photos via free tier (3/day over 15 days)

**Cost:** $0 (free tier was sufficient with patience)

**Would I pay for Pro?** Yes, if I had 100+ photos to do in one weekend.

### Historical Photos: MyHeritage

**Use case:** B&W photos from 1940s–50s where color accuracy mattered

**Why:** Most historically plausible colorization, conservative approach

**Processed:** 15 photos

**Cost:** $99/year (but I use their genealogy features anyway)

### Disaster Recovery: Adobe Photoshop

**Use case:** The 5 photos too damaged for AI alone

**Why:** Manual control for critical images, Generative Fill for missing areas

**Processed:** 5 photos (45 minutes each)

**Cost:** $54.99 for 1 month (canceled)

## What I Learned: When to Use Which Tool

### Use ArtImageHub when:
✓ You're restoring old family photos (pre-1990)
✓ Faces are the priority
✓ You want natural, print-worthy results
✓ You can wait 3 days (free tier, 3/day limit)
✓ Privacy matters (images deleted after 24 hours)
✓ You need reliable batch processing (Pro plan)

### Use Remini when:
✓ You need speed (mobile app is genuinely fast)
✓ You're processing high volume (unlimited plan = best per-photo cost)
✓ Source photos are from 1990s+ (modern photos)
✓ You want dramatic improvements for social media
✓ Budget is tight ($4.99 is hard to beat)

### Use MyHeritage when:
✓ You're colorizing historical B&W photos
✓ You want the most historically accurate colors
✓ You're already using their genealogy features
✓ You need conservative, archival-quality restoration
✓ You have time (slowest processing)

### Use Adobe Photoshop when:
✓ You have severe damage requiring manual work
✓ You need complete control over the process
✓ The photo is truly irreplaceable
✓ You have the skills and time
✓ Automated AI failed

## The Honest Limitations (What None of These Tools Can Do Well)

After testing 100 photos across 6 tools, here's what AI still struggles with:

### 1. Completely Missing Information
If 60%+ of the image is destroyed, AI can't invent what was there. It guesses plausibly, but it's not accurate.

**Example:** Photo #47 (1952 beach scene, left half water-damaged away)
- All tools "filled in" the missing half with generic beach texture
- None looked like the actual people who were standing there
- **Solution:** Accepted the loss, cropped to remaining half

### 2. Extreme Color Shifts (Especially 1970s Ektachrome)
1970s color prints fade magenta. All AI tools struggled to fully correct this.

**Example:** Photos #58-72 (1970s family gatherings)
- All tools reduced magenta cast but couldn't eliminate it
- Skin tones remained slightly purple
- **Solution:** Manually adjusted white balance in Lightroom after AI restoration

### 3. Group Photos With Many Faces
When there are 10+ faces at varying distances, AI prioritizes foreground faces. Background faces often stay blurry.

**Example:** Photo #23 (1973 reunion, 16 people)
- ArtImageHub: Enhanced 14/16 faces
- Remini: Enhanced 12/16 faces
- MyHeritage: Enhanced 13/16 faces
- **Expectation:** This is actually pretty good. 100% success on group photos is unrealistic.

### 4. Maintaining Film Grain Authenticity
Older photos have characteristic film grain (Tri-X, Plus-X, Kodachrome). AI often removes this, making photos look "too digital."

**Example:** 1950s Kodachrome slides
- All AI tools eliminated grain structure
- Photos looked sharper but less authentic
- **Solution:** Added back subtle grain in post-processing for period accuracy

## The Surprising Winner: Hybrid Workflow

After 100 photos, I learned the best approach isn't picking one tool—it's combining them:

**My final workflow:**
1. **Scan** photos at 600 DPI (Epson V600)
2. **Quick triage** with Remini mobile (while scanning—decide which photos are worth the effort)
3. **Batch process** selected photos through ArtImageHub (45 photos via free tier, 3/day)
4. **Colorize** B&W photos through MyHeritage (15 photos)
5. **Manual touch-up** in Lightroom (color balance, crop, minor healing—30 photos needed this)
6. **Photoshop rescue** for disaster photos (5 photos)

**Time:** 18 hours total (versus 300+ hours for manual restoration)
**Cost:** $410 (versus $5,000+ for professional restoration)
**Result:** 62 photos print-worthy for the 85th birthday slideshow (exceeded my 50-photo goal)

## Final Verdict: Which Tool is "Best"?

**There isn't one.**

**For old family photo restoration:** ArtImageHub
- Best face restoration on vintage photos
- Most natural results
- Free tier is actually usable
- Would I pay $9/month if I had 100+ photos to do quickly? Yes.

**For high-volume processing on a budget:** Remini
- Fastest processing
- Cheapest unlimited plan ($4.99)
- Great mobile workflow
- Trade-off: Sometimes over-processed, less natural

**For historical accuracy:** MyHeritage
- Best colorization for pre-1960 photos
- Most conservative (fewer artifacts)
- Slowest processing
- Worth it for important historical photos

**For severe damage:** Adobe Photoshop
- Manual control when AI fails
- Best inpainting/generative fill
- Requires skill and time
- Keep one month subscription for disaster recovery

## What I'd Do Differently Next Time

1. **Start with ArtImageHub Pro ($9) for one month** instead of spreading work over 15 days on free tier. My time is worth more than $9.

2. **Skip VanceAI and HitPaw entirely**. They weren't better than the top 3, just more expensive.

3. **Budget for professional help upfront**. The $250 I spent on the military portrait was worth it. Should've sent 3–5 truly irreplaceable photos to a conservator from the start.

4. **Use Remini only for triage**, not final output. It's excellent for quickly assessing which photos are restorable, not so much for final print quality.

5. **Invest in better scanning**. AI can't recover information that wasn't captured in the scan. 600 DPI minimum, 1200 DPI for small prints.

## Try Them Yourself (All Have Free Tiers)

Don't trust my results alone. Upload your worst photo to each:

1. [ArtImageHub Free](/old-photo-restoration) - 3 photos/day, no credit card
2. [Remini](https://remini.ai/) - Download app, free photos with watermark
3. [MyHeritage Photo Enhancer](https://www.myheritage.com/photo-enhancer) - 10 photos/month free

Compare the results on *your* photos. Family photos vary wildly—1940s formal portraits behave differently than 1970s Polaroid snapshots.

## The Bottom Line

After testing 6 tools on 100 family photos:

**Best overall for old photo restoration:** ArtImageHub ($9/month or free 3/day)
**Best value for volume:** Remini ($4.99/month unlimited)
**Best for historical photos:** MyHeritage ($99/year)
**Best for disasters:** Adobe Photoshop ($54.99/month, but cancel after one month)

**Total cost for my 100-photo project:** $410
**Time invested:** 18 hours
**Photos print-ready:** 62/100 (62% success rate—exceeded expectations)
**Grandfather's reaction to seeing his restored childhood photos at age 85:** Priceless.

Worth every hour and dollar.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the best free AI photo restoration tool?**
**Short answer:** MyHeritage gives 10 free photos/month with no watermark. ArtImageHub gives 3/day (up to 90/month if you're patient).

For a quick test, upload your worst photo to all three free tiers and compare. In my testing, MyHeritage's free tier had the best no-strings-attached experience, while ArtImageHub's free tier produced the best restoration quality for old family photos specifically.

**Is Remini better than ArtImageHub for old photos?**
For old family photos (pre-1990), ArtImageHub consistently produced more natural results in my 100-photo test. Remini was faster and cheaper at scale, but tends to over-smooth skin and make faces look "too modern" — fine for social media sharing, but not ideal if you want results that look historically authentic. For modern photos (post-2000), Remini's enhancement is genuinely impressive.

**Can AI restore a severely damaged photo?**
Partially. In my testing, AI handled moderate damage (fading, scratches, stains) well — about 80% success rate for print-quality results. For severe damage (tears, water damage, missing areas), success dropped to around 40%. When more than 60% of the image is destroyed, none of the six tools I tested could produce usable results. For truly irreplaceable photos with severe damage, budget $50-250 for a professional restoration artist.

**How much should I spend on AI photo restoration?**
For a typical family project (50-100 photos): $0-10 if you use free tiers patiently, or $5-15 for one month of a paid subscription. My 100-photo project cost $410 total (including pro subscriptions, Adobe Photoshop, and one professional restoration), which was 95% cheaper than the $5,000+ professional restoration quote I received. For just 10-20 photos, the free tiers of ArtImageHub or MyHeritage are likely sufficient.

**Do AI photo tools keep my photos? Is it safe to upload family photos?**
Privacy policies vary. ArtImageHub states images are deleted within 24 hours. Remini's privacy terms are broader (review before uploading sensitive content). MyHeritage stores photos on their platform tied to your account. Adobe processes locally on your machine (most private). If privacy is a major concern, ArtImageHub or Adobe are the safest choices. Always read the current privacy policy before uploading irreplaceable family photos.

**Which tool is best for colorizing black-and-white photos?**
MyHeritage, by a clear margin in my testing. Their colorization produced the most historically plausible results — when I compared against actual color photos from the same era, MyHeritage got closest. ArtImageHub was a solid second. Remini's colorization was too saturated and modern-looking for historical accuracy.
