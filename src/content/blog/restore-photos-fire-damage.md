## Types of Fire Damage to Photos

### Smoke Damage

**Characteristics:**
- Yellow/brown discoloration
- Soot deposits on surface
- Odor absorption
- Often salvageable

**Restoration Potential:** High - smoke damage responds well to digital correction.

### Heat Damage

**Characteristics:**
- Warping and curling
- Emulsion melting
- Color shifts
- Adhesion to glass/frames

**Restoration Potential:** Medium - depends on severity.

### Direct Burn Damage

**Characteristics:**
- Charred edges
- Missing sections
- Complete destruction in areas
- Partial survival common

**Restoration Potential:** Limited to surviving areas.

## Recovery Process

### Immediate Steps After Fire

1. Don't discard any photos immediately
2. Allow to dry naturally (no heat)
3. Photograph damaged photos before handling
4. Consult professionals for physical recovery

### Digital Restoration

**For Smoke-Damaged Photos:**
- Scan carefully without further damage
- AI removes discoloration
- Color correction restores original appearance

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can smoke-damaged photos that turned yellow be restored to original colors?**

Short answer: Yes, smoke yellowing is one of the most correctable types of damage. Our [AI restoration](/enhance-old-photos) analyzes the color shift and removes the yellow/brown cast, restoring natural colors. Results are often excellent.

**What if parts of the photo are burned away?**

Short answer: AI can restore surviving portions but cannot recreate completely missing sections. For photos with burned edges but intact center subjects, restoration focuses on the surviving image. Partial recovery is often meaningful.

**Should I try to clean soot off photos before scanning?**

Short answer: Be extremely careful—rubbing can cause more damage. Gently blow off loose particles if possible. For valuable photos, consult a professional conservator. Scan "as is" if cleaning risks damage; AI handles remaining discoloration digitally.
