## Frequently Asked Questions

**How far in advance should I start an anniversary photo restoration project?**

Short answer: Allow 2-4 weeks for a complete project including gathering photos, restoration, printing, and framing. AI restoration itself is quick (minutes), but gathering photos from family and quality printing takes time.

**Can I restore photos without the couple knowing for a surprise gift?**

Short answer: Yes, but you'll need to access photos discreetly. Ask other family members for scans, borrow photos briefly, or work with children/grandchildren. Digital restoration from scans doesn't require keeping original photos.

**What's a good anniversary gift for someone who has everything?**

Short answer: Restored photos are unique and irreplaceable—you can't buy them in a store. A beautifully restored wedding photo or timeline of their relationship is meaningful regardless of what they already own.

**Should I colorize black and white wedding photos?**

Short answer: Consider creating both versions—the original restored B&W and a colorized version. Some couples prefer the historical authenticity of black and white, while others love seeing their wedding day in color for the first time.
