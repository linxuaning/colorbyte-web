Water damage from floods, hurricanes, burst pipes, or leaks devastates family photo collections. Acting quickly and knowing proper techniques can save many water-damaged photographs that seem beyond hope.

Have water-damaged photos? After proper drying, our [AI photo restoration tool](/restore-old-family-photos) can repair remaining damage digitally.

## Emergency Response: First 48 Hours

### Immediate Actions

**Do This First:**
1. Wear gloves (contaminated water)
2. Keep photos wet until ready to dry
3. Separate stuck photos carefully
4. Prioritize unique, irreplaceable images

**Never Do This:**
- Don't let photos dry stuck together
- Don't use heat to speed drying
- Don't touch photo surfaces directly
- Don't discard photos that look ruined

### Freezing for Later

If overwhelmed, freeze wet photos:
- Place in zip-lock bags
- Freeze quickly
- Prevents further deterioration
- Process later when ready

## Cleaning and Drying

### Cleaning Process

1. Rinse gently in clean water
2. Remove mud and debris carefully
3. Handle by edges only
4. Work in batches

### Drying Methods

**Air Drying:**
- Lay flat on absorbent material
- Face up, not touching
- Change underlying material as needed
- Allow several days

**Best Conditions:**
- Cool temperature
- Good air circulation
- Away from direct sunlight
- Low humidity environment

## Digital Restoration After Drying

### What AI Can Fix

Once photos are properly dried and scanned, our [AI photo enhancer](/enhance-old-photos) addresses:

| Water Damage | Restoration |
|--------------|-------------|
| Staining | Color correction |
| Emulsion loss | Texture repair |
| Warping marks | Detail recovery |
| Fading | Contrast restoration |

### Severe Damage Cases

For photos with significant emulsion loss, our [AI photo upscaler](/ai-photo-upscaler) can enhance remaining detail and fill gaps intelligently.

## Types of Water Damage

### Flood Water

- Often contaminated
- Requires careful cleaning
- May contain mud, debris
- Act quickly to prevent mold

### Clean Water Leaks

- Less contamination
- Still requires proper drying
- Better prognosis for recovery

### Humidity Damage

- Gradual deterioration
- Often accompanied by mold
- See our [mold damage guide](/restore-photos-mold-damage)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can photos stuck together from water damage be separated?**

Short answer: Often yes, but carefully. Re-wet stuck photos in clean water, then gently separate. Never pull apart dry, stuck photos—this tears the emulsion. Professional conservators can help with valuable originals.

**How long do I have before wet photos are ruined?**

Short answer: Mold can start within 24-48 hours in humid conditions. Work quickly, or freeze photos to buy time. Even photos that develop mold can often be partially saved through cleaning and digital restoration.

**Should I try to dry photos quickly with heat?**

Short answer: Never use heat—it causes photos to curl, crack, and stick permanently. Air dry at room temperature with good ventilation. Patience produces better results than speed with wet photos.

**Can AI restore photos where the image has partially washed away?**

Short answer: AI can enhance and repair partially damaged images, sometimes remarkably well. Our [restoration tool](/enhance-old-photos) uses intelligent algorithms to reconstruct missing areas. Results depend on how much image remains.
